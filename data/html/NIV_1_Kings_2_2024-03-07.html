Do this so that you may prosper in all you do and wherever you go</span> <span class="text 1Kgs-2-4" id="text 1Kgs-2-4"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>and that the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> may keep his promise to me: ‘If your descendants watch how they live, and if they walk faithfully before me with all their heart and soul, you will never fail to have a successor on the throne of Israel.’</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-2-5" id="text 1Kgs-2-5"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>“Now you yourself know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me—what he did to the two commanders of Israel’s armies, Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. He killed them, shedding their blood in peacetime as if in battle, and with that blood he stained the belt around his waist and the sandals on his feet.</span> <span class="text 1Kgs-2-6" id="text 1Kgs-2-6"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>Deal with him according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to the grave in peace.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-2-7" id="text 1Kgs-2-7"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>“But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai of Gilead and let them be among those who eat at your table. They stood by me when I fled from your brother Absalom.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-2-8" id="text 1Kgs-2-8"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>“And remember, you have with you Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, who called down bitter curses on me the day I went to Mahanaim. When he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>: ‘I will not put you to death by the sword.’</span> <span class="text 1Kgs-2-9" id="text 1Kgs-2-9"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>But now, do not consider him innocent. You are a man of wisdom; you will know what to do to him. Bring his gray head down to the grave in blood.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-2-10" id="text 1Kgs-2-10"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>Then David rested with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David.</span> <span class="text 1Kgs-2-11" id="text 1Kgs-2-11"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>He had reigned forty years over Israel—seven years in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="text 1Kgs-2-12" id="text 1Kgs-2-12"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>So Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his rule was firmly established.</span></p> <h3><span class="text 1Kgs-2-13" id="text 1Kgs-2-13">Solomon’s Throne Established</span></h3><p><span class="text 1Kgs-2-13" id="text 1Kgs-2-13"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Now Adonijah, the son of Haggith, went to Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother. Bathsheba asked him, “Do you come peacefully?”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-2-13" id="text 1Kgs-2-13">He answered, “Yes, peacefully.”</span> <span class="text 1Kgs-2-14" id="text 1Kgs-2-14"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>Then he added, “I have something to say to you.”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-2-14" id="text 1Kgs-2-14">“You may say it,” she replied.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-2-15" id="text 1Kgs-2-15"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>“As you know,” he said, “the kingdom was mine. All Israel looked to me as their king. But things changed, and the kingdom has gone to my brother; for it has come to him from the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.</span> <span class="text 1Kgs-2-16" id="text 1Kgs-2-16"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>Now I have one request to make of you.

He had a throne brought for the king’s mother, and she sat down at his right hand.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-2-20" id="text 1Kgs-2-20"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>“I have one small request to make of you,” she said. “Do not refuse me.”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-2-20" id="text 1Kgs-2-20">The king replied, “Make it, my mother; I will not refuse you.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-2-21" id="text 1Kgs-2-21"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>So she said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given in marriage to your brother Adonijah.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-2-22" id="text 1Kgs-2-22"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>King Solomon answered his mother, “Why do you request Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? You might as well request the kingdom for him—after all, he is my older brother—yes, for him and for Abiathar the priest and Joab son of Zeruiah!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-2-23" id="text 1Kgs-2-23"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>Then King Solomon swore by the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>: “May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if Adonijah does not pay with his life for this request!</span> <span class="text 1Kgs-2-24" id="text 1Kgs-2-24"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>And now, as surely as the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> lives—he who has established me securely on the throne of my father David and has founded a dynasty for me as he promised—Adonijah shall be put to death today!”</span> <span class="text 1Kgs-2-25" id="text 1Kgs-2-25"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>So King Solomon gave orders to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he struck down Adonijah and he died.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-2-26" id="text 1Kgs-2-26"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>To Abiathar the priest the king said, “Go back to your fields in Anathoth. You deserve to die, but I will not put you to death now, because you carried the ark of the Sovereign <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> before my father David and shared all my father’s hardships.”</span> <span class="text 1Kgs-2-27" id="text 1Kgs-2-27"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>So Solomon removed Abiathar from the priesthood of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, fulfilling the word the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> had spoken at Shiloh about the house of Eli.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-2-28" id="text 1Kgs-2-28"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>When the news reached Joab, who had conspired with Adonijah though not with Absalom, he fled to the tent of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> and took hold of the horns of the altar.</span> <span class="text 1Kgs-2-29" id="text 1Kgs-2-29"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>King Solomon was told that Joab had fled to the tent of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> and was beside the altar. Then Solomon ordered Benaiah son of Jehoiada, “Go, strike him down!”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-2-30" id="text 1Kgs-2-30"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>So Benaiah entered the tent of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> and said to Joab, “The king says, ‘Come out!’”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-2-30" id="text 1Kgs-2-30">But he answered, “No, I will die here.”</span></p><p><span class="text 1Kgs-2-30" id="text 1Kgs-2-30">Benaiah reported to the king, “This is how Joab answered me.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-2-31" id="text 1Kgs-2-31"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>Then the king commanded Benaiah, “Do as he says. Strike him down and bury him, and so clear me and my whole family of the guilt of the innocent blood that Joab shed.</span> <span class="text 1Kgs-2-32" id="text 1Kgs-2-32"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>The <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> will repay him for the blood he shed, because without my father David knowing it he attacked two men and killed them with the sword. Both of them—Abner son of Ner, commander of Israel’s army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of Judah’s army—were better men and more upright than he.</span> <span class="text 1Kgs-2-33" id="text 1Kgs-2-33"><sup class="versenum">33 </sup>May the guilt of their blood rest on the head of Joab and his descendants forever. But on David and his descendants, his house and his throne, may there be the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>’s peace forever.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-2-34" id="text 1Kgs-2-34"><sup class="versenum">34 </sup>So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up and struck down Joab and killed him, and he was buried at his home out in the country.</span> <span class="text 1Kgs-2-35" id="text 1Kgs-2-35"><sup class="versenum">35 </sup>The king put Benaiah son of Jehoiada over the army in Joab’s position and replaced Abiathar with Zadok the priest.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-2-36" id="text 1Kgs-2-36"><sup class="versenum">36 </sup>Then the king sent for Shimei and said to him, “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, but do not go anywhere else.</span> <span class="text 1Kgs-2-37" id="text 1Kgs-2-37"><sup class="versenum">37 </sup>The day you leave and cross the Kidron Valley, you can be sure you will die; your blood will be on your own head.”</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-2-38" id="text 1Kgs-2-38"><sup class="versenum">38 </sup>Shimei answered the king, “What you say is good.
