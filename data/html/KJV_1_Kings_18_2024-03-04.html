And there was a sore famine in Samaria.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-3" id="en-KJV-9345"><sup class="versenum">3 </sup>And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> greatly:</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-4" id="en-KJV-9346"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-5" id="en-KJV-9347"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-6" id="en-KJV-9348"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-7" id="en-KJV-9349"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah?</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-8" id="en-KJV-9350"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-9" id="en-KJV-9351"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-10" id="en-KJV-9352"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>As the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-11" id="en-KJV-9353"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-12" id="en-KJV-9354"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> from my youth.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-13" id="en-KJV-9355"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, how I hid an hundred men of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>'s prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-14" id="en-KJV-9356"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he shall slay me.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-15" id="en-KJV-9357"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>And Elijah said, As the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-16" id="en-KJV-9358"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-17" id="en-KJV-9359"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-18" id="en-KJV-9360"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>, and thou hast followed Baalim.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-19" id="en-KJV-9361"><sup class="versenum">19 </sup>Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-20" id="en-KJV-9362"><sup class="versenum">20 </sup>So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-21" id="en-KJV-9363"><sup class="versenum">21 </sup>And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-22" id="en-KJV-9364"><sup class="versenum">22 </sup>Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-23" id="en-KJV-9365"><sup class="versenum">23 </sup>Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-24" id="en-KJV-9366"><sup class="versenum">24 </sup>And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-25" id="en-KJV-9367"><sup class="versenum">25 </sup>And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-26" id="en-KJV-9368"><sup class="versenum">26 </sup>And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-27" id="en-KJV-9369"><sup class="versenum">27 </sup>And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-28" id="en-KJV-9370"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-29" id="en-KJV-9371"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-30" id="en-KJV-9372"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me.

And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-43" id="en-KJV-9385"><sup class="versenum">43 </sup>And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-44" id="en-KJV-9386"><sup class="versenum">44 </sup>And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down that the rain stop thee not.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-45" id="en-KJV-9387"><sup class="versenum">45 </sup>And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-18-46" id="en-KJV-9388"><sup class="versenum">46 </sup>And the hand of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.</span></p> </div>
