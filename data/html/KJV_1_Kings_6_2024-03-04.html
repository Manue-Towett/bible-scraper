and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-6-4" id="en-KJV-8901"><sup class="versenum">4 </sup>And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-6-5" id="en-KJV-8902"><sup class="versenum">5 </sup>And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-6-6" id="en-KJV-8903"><sup class="versenum">6 </sup>The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-6-7" id="en-KJV-8904"><sup class="versenum">7 </sup>And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-6-8" id="en-KJV-8905"><sup class="versenum">8 </sup>The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-6-9" id="en-KJV-8906"><sup class="versenum">9 </sup>So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-6-10" id="en-KJV-8907"><sup class="versenum">10 </sup>And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-6-11" id="en-KJV-8908"><sup class="versenum">11 </sup>And the word of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span> came to Solomon, saying,</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-6-12" id="en-KJV-8909"><sup class="versenum">12 </sup>Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father:</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-6-13" id="en-KJV-8910"><sup class="versenum">13 </sup>And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-6-14" id="en-KJV-8911"><sup class="versenum">14 </sup>So Solomon built the house, and finished it.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-6-15" id="en-KJV-8912"><sup class="versenum">15 </sup>And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-6-16" id="en-KJV-8913"><sup class="versenum">16 </sup>And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-6-17" id="en-KJV-8914"><sup class="versenum">17 </sup>And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-6-18" id="en-KJV-8915"><sup class="versenum">18 </sup>And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar;

and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-6-28" id="en-KJV-8925"><sup class="versenum">28 </sup>And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-6-29" id="en-KJV-8926"><sup class="versenum">29 </sup>And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-6-30" id="en-KJV-8927"><sup class="versenum">30 </sup>And the floors of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-6-31" id="en-KJV-8928"><sup class="versenum">31 </sup>And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.</span></p> <p><span class="text 1Kgs-6-32" id="en-KJV-8929"><sup class="versenum">32 </sup>The two doors also were of olive tree;
