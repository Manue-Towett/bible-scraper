"Amplified Bible, Classic Edition",AMPC,1 John,2,,"My little children, I write you these things so that you may not violate Gods law and sin. But if anyone should sin, we have an Advocate (One Who will intercede for us) with the Father[it is] Jesus Christ [the all] righteous [upright, just, Who conforms to the Fathers will in every purpose, thought, and action]. 2 And He [[a]that same Jesus Himself] is the propitiation (the atoning sacrifice) for our sins, and not for ours alone but also for [the sins of] the whole world. 3 And this is how we may discern [[b]daily, by experience] that we are coming to know Him [to perceive, recognize, understand, and become better acquainted with Him]: if we keep (bear in mind, observe, practice) His teachings (precepts, commandments). 4 Whoever says, I know Him [I perceive, recognize, understand, and am acquainted with Him] but fails to keep and obey His commandments (teachings) is a liar, and the Truth [[c]of the Gospel] is not in him. 5 But he who keeps (treasures) His Word [who bears in mind His precepts, who observes His message in its entirety], truly in him has the love of and for God been perfected (completed, reached maturity). By this we may perceive (know, recognize, and be sure) that we are in Him: 6 Whoever says he abides in Him ought [as [d]a personal debt] to walk and conduct himself in the same way in which He walked and conducted Himself. 7 Beloved, I am writing you no new commandment, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning; the old commandment is the message which you have heard [the [e]doctrine of salvation through Christ]. 8 Yet I am writing you a new commandment, which is true (is realized) in Him and in you, because the darkness ([f]moral blindness) is clearing away and the true Light ([g]the revelation of God in Christ) is already shining. 9 Whoever says he is in the Light and [yet] hates his brother [Christian, [h]born-again child of God his Father] is in darkness even until now. 10 Whoever loves his brother [believer] abides (lives) in the Light, and in It or in him there is no occasion for stumbling or cause for error or sin. 11 But he who hates (detests, despises) his brother [[i]in Christ] is in darkness and walking (living) in the dark; he is straying and does not perceive or know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes. 12 I am writing to you, little children, because for His names sake your sins are forgiven [pardoned through His name and on account of confessing His name]. 13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you have come to know (recognize, be aware of, and understand) Him Who [has existed] from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have been victorious over the wicked [one]. I write to you, [j]boys (lads), because you have come to know (recognize and be aware) of the Father. 14 I write to you, fathers, because you have come to know (recognize, be conscious of, and understand) Him Who [has existed] from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong and vigorous, and the Word of God is [always] abiding in you (in your hearts), and you have been victorious over the wicked one. 15 Do not love or cherish the world or the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in the worldthe lust of the flesh [craving for sensual gratification] and the lust of the eyes [greedy longings of the mind] and the pride of life [assurance in ones own resources or in the stability of earthly things]these do not come from the Father but are from the world [itself]. 17 And the world passes away and disappears, and with it the forbidden cravings (the passionate desires, the lust) of it; but he who does the will of God and carries out His purposes in his life abides (remains) forever. 18 [k]Boys (lads), it is the last time (hour, the end of this age). And as you have heard that the antichrist [he who will oppose Christ in the guise of Christ] is coming, even now many antichrists have arisen, which confirms our belief that it is the final (the end) time. 19 They went out from our number, but they did not [really] belong to us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us. But [they withdrew] that it might be plain that they all are not of us. 20 But you have been anointed by [you hold a sacred appointment from, you have been given an unction from] the Holy One, and you all know [the Truth] or you know all things. 21 I write to you not because you are ignorant and do not perceive and know the Truth, but because you do perceive and know it, and [know positively] that nothing false (no deception, no lie) is of the Truth. 22 Who is [such a] liar as he who denies that Jesus is the Christ (the Messiah)? He is the antichrist (the antagonist of Christ), who [[l]habitually] denies and refuses to acknowledge the Father and the Son. 23 No one who [[m]habitually] denies (disowns) the Son [n]even has the Father. Whoever confesses (acknowledges and has) the Son has the Father also. 24 As for you, keep in your hearts what you have heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the first dwells and remains in you, then you will dwell in the Son and in the Father [always]. 25 And this is what He Himself has promised usthe life, the eternal [life]. 26 I write this to you with reference to those who would deceive you [seduce and lead you astray]. 27 But as for you, the anointing (the sacred appointment, the unction) which you received from Him abides [[o]permanently] in you; [so] then you have no need that anyone should instruct you. But just as His anointing teaches you concerning everything and is true and is no falsehood, so you must abide in (live in, never depart from) Him [being [p]rooted in Him, knit to Him], just as [His anointing] has taught you [to do]. 28 And now, little children, abide (live, remain [q]permanently) in Him, so that when He is made visible, we may have and enjoy perfect confidence (boldness, assurance) and not be ashamed and shrink from Him at His coming. 29 If you know (perceive and are sure) that He [Christ] is [absolutely] righteous [conforming to the Fathers will in purpose, thought, and action], you may also know (be sure) that everyone who does righteously [and is therefore in like manner conformed to the divine will] is born (begotten) of Him [[r]God]. "
21st Century King James Version,KJ21,1 John,5,,"Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and every one that loveth Him that begot, loveth Him also that is begotten by Him. 2 By this we know that we love the children of God: when we love God and keep His commandments. 3 For this is the love of God: that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not grievous. 4 For whosoever is born of God overcometh the world. And this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. 5 Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? 6 This is He that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth. 7 For there are three that bear record in Heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost; and these three are one. 8 And there are three that bear witness on earth: the Spirit, and the water, and the blood; and these three agree in one. 9 If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater, for this is the witness of God which He hath testified of His Son. 10 He that believeth in the Son of God hath the witness in himself; he that believeth not God hath made Him a liar, because he believeth not the record that God gave of His Son. 11 And this is the record: that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. 12 He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son hath not life. 13 These things I have written unto you that believe in the name of the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe in the name of the Son of God. 14 And this is the confidence that we have in Him: that if we ask anything according to His will, He heareth us. 15 And if we know that He hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of Him. 16 If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask and He shall give him life, for those who sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death. I do not say that he shall pray about it. 17 All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not unto death. 18 We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not, but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not. 19 And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness. 20 And we know that the Son of God is come and hath given us an understanding, that we may know Him that is true; and we are in Him that is true, even in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and Eternal Life. 21 Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen. "
American Standard Version,ASV,1 John,1,,"That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we beheld, and our hands handled, concerning the [a]Word of life 2 (and the life was manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and declare unto you the life, the eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us); 3 that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you also, that ye also may have fellowship with us: yea, and our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ: 4 and these things we write, that [b]our joy may be made full. 5 And this is the message which we have heard from him and announce unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. 6 If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we lie, and do not the truth: 7 but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanseth us from all sin. 8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. "
Amplified Bible,AMP,1 John,4,Testing the Spirits,"Beloved, do not believe every spirit [speaking through a self-proclaimed prophet]; instead test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets and teachers have gone out into the world. 2 By this you know and recognize the Spirit of God: every spirit that acknowledges and confesses [the fact] that Jesus Christ has [actually] come in the flesh [as a man] is from God [God is its source]; 3 and every spirit that does not confess Jesus [acknowledging that He has come in the flesh, but would deny any of the Sons true nature] is not of God; this is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming, and is now already in the world. 4 Little children (believers, dear ones), you are of God and you belong to Him and have [already] overcome them [the agents of the antichrist]; because He who is in you is greater than he (Satan) who is in the world [of sinful mankind]. 5 They [who teach twisted doctrine] are of the world and belong to it; therefore they speak from the [viewpoint of the] world [with its immoral freedom and baseless theoriesdemanding compliance with their opinions and ridiculing the values of the upright], and the [gullible one of the] world listens closely and pays attention to them. 6 We [who teach Gods word] are from God [energized by the Holy Spirit], and whoever knows God [through personal experience] listens to us [and has a deeper understanding of Him]. Whoever is not of God does not listen to us. By this we know [without any doubt] the spirit of truth [motivated by God] and the spirit of error [motivated by Satan]. 7 Beloved, let us [unselfishly] [a]love and seek the best for one another, for love is from God; and everyone who loves [others] is born of God and knows God [through personal experience]. 8 The one who does not love has not become acquainted with God [does not and never did know Him], for God is love. [He is the originator of love, and it is an enduring attribute of His nature.] 9 By this the love of God was displayed in us, in that God has sent His [One and] only begotten Son [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind] into the world so that we might live through Him. 10 In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation [that is, the atoning sacrifice, and the satisfying offering] for our sins [fulfilling Gods requirement for justice against sin and placating His wrath]. 11 Beloved, if God so loved us [in this incredible way], we also ought to love one another. 12 No one has seen God at any time. But if we love one another [with unselfish concern], God abides in us, and His love [the love that is His essence abides in us and] is completed and perfected in us. 13 By this we know [with confident assurance] that we abide in Him and He in us, because He has given to us His [Holy] Spirit. 14 We [who were with Him in person] have seen and testify [as eye-witnesses] that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world. 15 Whoever confesses and acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. 16 We have come to know [by personal observation and experience], and have believed [with deep, consistent faith] the love which God has for us. God is love, and the one who abides in love abides in God, and God abides continually in him. 17 In this [union and fellowship with Him], love is completed and perfected with us, so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment [with assurance and boldness to face Him]; because as He is, so are we in this world. 18 There is no fear in love [dread does not exist]. But perfect (complete, full-grown) love drives out fear, because fear involves [the expectation of divine] punishment, so the one who is afraid [of Gods judgment] is not perfected in love [has not grown into a sufficient understanding of Gods love]. 19 We love, because [b]He first loved us. 20 If anyone says, I love God, and hates (works against) his [Christian] brother he is a liar; for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen. 21 And this commandment we have from Him, that the one who loves God should also [unselfishly] love his brother and seek the best for him. "
Amplified Bible,AMP,1 John,5,Overcoming the World,"Everyone who believes [with a deep, abiding trust in the fact] that Jesus is the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed) is born of God [that is, reborn from abovespiritually transformed, renewed, and set apart for His purpose], and everyone who loves the Father also loves [a]the child born of Him. 2 By this we know [without any doubt] that we love the children of God: [expressing that love] when we love God and obey His commandments. 3 For the [true] love of God is this: that we habitually keep His commandments and remain focused on His precepts. And His commandments and His precepts are not difficult [to obey]. 4 For [b]everyone born of God is victorious and overcomes the world; and this is the victory that has conquered and overcome the worldour [continuing, persistent] faith [in Jesus the Son of God]. 5 Who is the one who is victorious and overcomes the world? It is the one who believes and recognizes the fact that Jesus is the Son of God. 6 This is He who came through water and blood [His baptism and death], Jesus Christnot by the water only, but by the water and the blood. It is the [Holy] Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. [He is the essence and origin of truth itself.] 7 For there are three witnesses: 8 the Spirit and the water and the blood; and these three are in agreement [their testimony is perfectly consistent]. 9 If we accept [as we do] the testimony of men [that is, if we are willing to take the sworn statements of fallible humans as evidence], the testimony of God is greater [far more authoritative]; for this is the testimony of God, that He has testified regarding His Son. 10 The one who believes in the Son of God [who adheres to, trusts in, and relies confidently on Him as Savior] has the testimony within himself [because he can speak authoritatively about Christ from his own personal experience]. The one who does not believe God [in this way] has made Him [out to be] a liar, because he has not believed in the evidence that God has given regarding His Son. 11 And the testimony is this: God has given us eternal life [we already possess it], and this life is in His Son [resulting in our spiritual completeness, and eternal companionship with Him]. 12 He who has the Son [by accepting Him as Lord and Savior] has the life [that is eternal]; he who does not have the Son of God [by personal faith] does not have the life. 13 These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God [which represents all that Jesus Christ is and does], so that you will know [with settled and absolute knowledge] that you [already] have eternal life. 14 This is the [remarkable degree of] confidence which we [as believers are entitled to] have before Him: that [c]if we ask anything according to His will, [that is, consistent with His plan and purpose] He hears us. 15 And if we know [for a fact, as indeed we do] that He hears and listens to us in whatever we ask, we [also] know [with settled and absolute knowledge] that we have [granted to us] the requests which we have asked from Him. 16 If anyone sees his brother committing a sin that does not lead to death, he will pray and ask [on the believers behalf] and God will for him give life to those whose sin is not leading to death. There is a sin that leads to death; I do not say that one should pray for this [kind of sin]. 17 All wrongdoing is sin, and there is sin that does not lead to death [one can repent of it and be forgiven]. 18 We know [with confidence] that anyone born of God does not habitually sin; but He (Jesus) who was born of God [carefully] keeps and protects him, and the evil one does not touch him. 19 We know [for a fact] that we are of God, and the whole world [around us] lies in the power of the evil one [opposing God and His precepts]. 20 And we [have seen and] know [by personal experience] that the Son of God has [actually] come [to this world], and has given us understanding and insight so that we may [progressively and personally] know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is truein His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. 21 Little children (believers, dear ones), guard yourselves from idols[false teachings, moral compromises, and anything that would take Gods place in your heart]. "
BRG Bible,BRG,1 John,3,,"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. 2 Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. 3 And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure. 4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law. 5 And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin. 6 Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him. 7 Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous. 8 He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. 9 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. 10 In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother. 11 For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another. 12 Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brothers righteous. 13 Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. 14 We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death. 15 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. 16 Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. 17 But whoso hath this worlds good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him? 18 My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth. 19 And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him. 20 For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. 21 Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God. 22 And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. 23 And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment. 24 And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us. "
American Standard Version,ASV,1 John,2,,"My little children, these things write I unto you that ye may not sin. And if any man sin, we have an [a]Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: 2 and he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the whole world. 3 And hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. 4 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him; 5 but whoso keepeth his word, in him verily hath the love of God been perfected. Hereby we know that we are in him: 6 he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked. 7 Beloved, no new commandment write I unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning: the old commandment is the word which ye heard. 8 Again, a new commandment write I unto you, which thing is true in him and in you; because the darkness is passing away, and the true light already shineth. 9 He that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother, is in the darkness even until now. 10 He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him. 11 But he that hateth his brother is in the darkness, and walketh in the darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because the darkness hath blinded his eyes. 12 I write unto you, my little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his names sake. 13 I write unto you, fathers, because ye know him who is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the evil one. [b]I have written unto you, little children, because ye know the Father. 14 [c]I have written unto you, fathers, because ye know him who is from the beginning. [d]I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the evil one. 15 Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the vainglory of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. 17 And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever. 18 Little children, it is the last hour: and as ye heard that antichrist cometh, even now have there arisen many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last hour. 19 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest [e]that they all are not of us. 20 And ye have an anointing from the Holy One, [f]and ye know all things. 21 I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and [g]because no lie is of the truth. 22 Who is the liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, even he that denieth the Father and the Son. 23 Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that confesseth the Son hath the Father also. 24 As for you, let that abide in you which ye heard from the beginning. If that which ye heard from the beginning abide in you, ye also shall abide in the Son, and in the Father. 25 And this is the promise which he promised [h]us, even the life eternal. 26 These things have I written unto you concerning them that would lead you astray. 27 And as for you, the anointing which ye received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any one teach you; but as his anointing teacheth you concerning all things, [i]and is true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you, [j]ye abide in him. 28 And now, my little children, abide in him; that, if he shall be manifested, we may have boldness, and not be ashamed [k]before him at his [l]coming. 29 If ye know that he is righteous, [m]ye know that every one also that doeth righteousness is begotten of him. "
American Standard Version,ASV,1 John,3,,"Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of God; and such we are. For this cause the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. 2 Beloved, now are we children of God, and it is not yet made manifest what we shall be. We know that, if [a]he shall be manifested, we shall be like him; for we shall see him even as he is. 3 And every one that hath this hope set on him purifieth himself, even as he is pure. 4 Every one that doeth sin doeth also lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness. 5 And ye know that he was manifested to [b]take away sins; and in him is no sin. 6 Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither [c]knoweth him. 7 My little children, let no man lead you astray: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous: 8 he that doeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. To this end was the Son of God manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. 9 Whosoever is begotten of God doeth no sin, because his seed abideth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is begotten of God. 10 In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother. 11 For this is the message which ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another: 12 not as Cain was of the evil one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his works were evil, and his brothers righteous. 13 Marvel not, brethren, if the world hateth you. 14 We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not abideth in death. 15 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. 16 Hereby know we love, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. 17 But whoso hath the worlds goods, and beholdeth his brother in need, and shutteth up his compassion from him, how doth the love of God abide in him? 18 My little children, let us not love in word, neither with the tongue; but in deed and truth. 19 Hereby shall we know that we are of the truth, and shall [d]assure our heart [e]before him: 20 because if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. 21 Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have boldness toward God; 22 and whatsoever we ask we receive of him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight. 23 And this is his commandment, that we should [f]believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he gave us commandment. 24 And he that keepeth his commandments abideth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he gave us. "
Amplified Bible,AMP,1 John,2,Christ Is Our Advocate,"My little children (believers, dear ones), I am writing you these things so that you will not sin and violate Gods law. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate [who will intercede for us] with the Father: Jesus Christ the righteous [the upright, the just One, who conforms to the Fathers will in every waypurpose, thought, and action]. 2 And He [that same Jesus] is the propitiation for our sins [the atoning sacrifice that holds back the wrath of God that would otherwise be directed at us because of our sinful natureour worldliness, our lifestyle]; and not for ours alone, but also for [the sins of all believers throughout] the whole world. 3 And this is how we know [daily, by experience] that we have come to know Him [to understand Him and be more deeply acquainted with Him]: if we habitually keep [focused on His precepts and obey] His commandments (teachings). 4 Whoever says, I have come to know Him, but does not habitually keep [focused on His precepts and obey] His commandments (teachings), is a liar, and the truth [of the divine word] is not in him. 5 But whoever habitually keeps His word and obeys His precepts [and treasures His message in its entirety], in him the love of God has truly been perfected [it is completed and has reached maturity]. By this we know [for certain] that we are in Him: 6 whoever says he lives in Christ [that is, whoever says he has accepted Him as God and Savior] ought [as a moral obligation] to walk and conduct himself just as He walked and conducted Himself. 7 Beloved, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning; the old commandment is the message which you have heard [before from us]. 8 On the other hand, I am writing a new commandment to you, which is true and realized in Christ and in you, because the darkness [of moral blindness] is clearing away and the true Light [the revelation of God in Christ] is already shining. 9 The one who says he is in the Light [in consistent fellowship with Christ] and yet [a]habitually hates (works against) his brother [in Christ] is in the darkness until now. 10 The one who [b]loves and unselfishly seeks the best for his [believing] brother lives in the Light, and in him there is no occasion for stumbling or offense [he does not hurt the cause of Christ or lead others to sin]. 11 But the one who habitually hates (works against) his brother [in Christ] is in [spiritual] darkness and is walking in the darkness, and does not know where he is going because the darkness has blinded his eyes. 12 I am writing to you, little children (believers, dear ones), because your sins have been forgiven for His names sake [you have been pardoned and released from spiritual debt through His name because you have confessed His name, believing in Him as Savior]. 13 I am writing to you, fathers [those believers who are spiritually mature], because you know Him who has existed from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men [those believers who are growing in spiritual maturity], because you have been victorious and have overcome the evil one. I have written to you, children [those who are new believers, those spiritually immature], because you have come to know the Father. 14 I have written to you, fathers, because you know Him who has existed from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong and vigorous, and the word of God remains [always] in you, and you have been victorious over the evil one [by accepting Jesus as Savior]. 15 Do not love the world [of sin that opposes God and His precepts], nor the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in the worldthe lust and sensual craving of the flesh and the lust and longing of the eyes and the boastful pride of life [pretentious confidence in ones resources or in the stability of earthly things]these do not come from the Father, but are from the world. 17 The world is passing away, and with it its lusts [the shameful pursuits and ungodly longings]; but the one who does the will of God and carries out His purposes lives forever. 18 Children, it is the last hour [the end of this age]; and just as you heard that the antichrist is coming [the one who will oppose Christ and attempt to replace Him], even now many antichrists (false teachers) have appeared, which confirms our belief that it is the last hour. 19 They went out from us [seeming at first to be Christians], but they were not really of us [because they were not truly born again and spiritually transformed]; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but they went out [teaching false doctrine], so that it would be clearly shown that none of them are of us. 20 But you have an anointing from the Holy One [you have been set apart, specially gifted and prepared by the Holy Spirit], and all of you know [the truth because He teaches us, illuminates our minds, and guards us from error]. 21 I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it, and because no lie [nothing false, no deception] is of the truth. 22 Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed)? This is the antichrist [the enemy and antagonist of Christ], the one who denies and consistently refuses to acknowledge the Father and the Son. 23 Whoever denies and repudiates the Son does not have the Father; the one who confesses and acknowledges the Son has the Father also. 24 As for you, let that remain in you [keeping in your hearts that message of salvation] which you heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the beginning remains in you, you too will remain in the Son and in the Father [forever]. 25 This is the promise which He Himself promised useternal life. 26 These things I have written to you with reference to those who are trying to deceive you [seducing you and leading you away from the truth and sound doctrine]. 27 As for you, the anointing [the special gift, the preparation] which you received from Him remains [permanently] in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you. But just as His anointing teaches you [giving you insight through the presence of the Holy Spirit] about all things, and is true and is not a lie, and just as His anointing has taught you, [c]you must remain in Him [being rooted in Him, knit to Him]. 28 Now, little children (believers, dear ones), remain in Him [with unwavering faith], so that when He appears [at His return], we may have [perfect] confidence and not be ashamed and shrink away from Him at His coming. 29 If you know that He is absolutely righteous, you know [for certain] that everyone who practices righteousness [doing what is right and conforming to Gods will] has been born of Him. "
21st Century King James Version,KJ21,1 John,4,,"Beloved, believe not every spirit, but test the spirits whether they are of God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God. 3 And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not of God; and such is the spirit of Antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come, and even now already it is in the world. 4 Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world. 5 They are of the world; therefore they speak of the world, and the world heareth them. 6 We are of God; he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby we know the Spirit of truth, and the spirit of error. 7 Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God, and every one that loveth is born of God and knoweth God. 8 He that loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is love. 9 In this was manifested the love of God toward us: that God sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him. 10 Herein is love: not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins. 11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. 12 No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and His love is perfected in us. 13 Hereby we know that we dwell in Him and He in us: because He hath given us of His Spirit. 14 And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the world. 15 Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. 16 And we have known and believed the love that God hath for us. God is love, and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. 17 Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the Day of Judgment; because as He is, so are we in this world. 18 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love. 19 We love Him, because He first loved us. 20 If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar. For he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? 21 And this commandment we have from Him: that he who loveth God love his brother also. "
"Amplified Bible, Classic Edition",AMPC,1 John,3,,"See what [[a]an incredible] quality of love the Father has given (shown, bestowed on) us, that we should [be permitted to] be named and called and counted the children of God! And so we are! The reason that the world does not know (recognize, acknowledge) us is that it does not know (recognize, acknowledge) Him. 2 Beloved, we are [even here and] now Gods children; it is not yet disclosed (made clear) what we shall be [hereafter], but we know that when He comes and is manifested, we shall [[b]as Gods children] resemble and be like Him, for we shall see Him [c]just as He [really] is. 3 And everyone who has this hope [resting] on Him cleanses (purifies) himself just as He is pure (chaste, undefiled, guiltless). 4 Everyone who commits (practices) sin is guilty of lawlessness; for [that is what] sin is, lawlessness (the breaking, violating of Gods law by transgression or neglectbeing unrestrained and unregulated by His commands and His will). 5 You know that He appeared in visible form and became Man to take away [upon Himself] sins, and in Him there is no sin [[d]essentially and forever]. 6 No one who abides in Him [who lives and remains [e]in communion with and in obedience to Himdeliberately, knowingly, and [f]habitually] commits (practices) sin. No one who [habitually] sins has either seen or known Him [recognized, perceived, or understood Him, or has had an experiential acquaintance with Him]. 7 [g]Boys (lads), let no one deceive and lead you astray. He who practices righteousness [who is upright, conforming to the divine will in purpose, thought, and action, living a consistently conscientious life] is righteous, even as He is righteous. 8 [But] he who commits sin [who practices evildoing] is of the devil [takes his character from the evil one], for the devil has sinned (violated the divine law) from the beginning. The reason the Son of God was made manifest (visible) was to undo (destroy, loosen, and dissolve) the works the devil [has done]. 9 No one born (begotten) of God [deliberately, knowingly, and [h]habitually] practices sin, for Gods nature abides in him [His principle of life, the divine sperm, remains permanently within him]; and he cannot practice sinning because he is born (begotten) of God. 10 By this it is made clear who take their nature from God and are His children and who take their nature from the devil and are his children: no one who does not practice righteousness [who does not conform to Gods will in purpose, thought, and action] is of God; neither is anyone who does not love his brother (his fellow [i]believer in Christ). 11 For this is the message (the announcement) which you have heard from the first, that we should love one another, 12 [And] not be like Cain who [took his nature and got his motivation] from the evil one and slew his brother. And why did he slay him? Because his deeds (activities, works) were wicked and malicious and his brothers were righteous (virtuous). 13 Do not be surprised and wonder, brethren, that the world detests and pursues you with hatred. 14 We know that we have passed over out of death into Life by the fact that we love the brethren (our fellow Christians). He who does not love abides (remains, is [j]held and kept continually) in [spiritual] death. 15 Anyone who hates (abominates, detests) his brother [in Christ] is [at heart] a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding ([k]persevering) within him. 16 By this we come to know (progressively to recognize, to perceive, to understand) the [essential] love: that He laid down His [own] life for us; and we ought to lay [our] lives down for [those who are our] brothers [[l]in Him]. 17 But if anyone has this worlds goods (resources for sustaining life) and sees his brother and [m]fellow believer in need, yet closes his heart of compassion against him, how can the love of God live and remain in him? 18 Little children, let us not love [merely] in theory or in speech but in deed and in truth (in practice and in sincerity). 19 By this we shall come to know (perceive, recognize, and understand) that we are of the Truth, and can reassure (quiet, conciliate, and pacify) our hearts in His presence, 20 Whenever our hearts in [[n]tormenting] self-accusation make us feel guilty and condemn us. [For [o]we are in Gods hands.] For He is above and greater than our consciences (our hearts), and He knows (perceives and understands) everything [nothing is hidden from Him]. 21 And, beloved, if our consciences (our hearts) do not accuse us [if they do not make us feel guilty and condemn us], we have confidence (complete assurance and boldness) before God, 22 And we receive from Him whatever we ask, because we [[p]watchfully] obey His orders [observe His suggestions and injunctions, follow His plan for us] and [[q]habitually] practice what is pleasing to Him. 23 And this is His order (His command, His injunction): that we should believe in (put our faith and trust in and adhere to and rely on) the name of His Son Jesus Christ (the Messiah), and that we should love one another, just as He has commanded us. 24 All who keep His commandments [who obey His orders and follow His plan, live and continue to live, to stay and] abide in Him, and He in them. [[r]They let Christ be a home to them and they are the home of Christ.] And by this we know and understand and have the proof that He [really] lives and makes His home in us: by the [Holy] Spirit Whom He has given us. "
21st Century King James Version,KJ21,1 John,3,,"Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God! Therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew Him not. 2 Beloved, now we are the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is. 3 And every man that hath this hope in Him purifieth himself, even as He is pure. 4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law, for sin is the transgression of the law. 5 And ye know that He was manifested to take away our sins, and in Him is no sin. 6 Whosoever abideth in Him sinneth not; whosoever sinneth hath not seen Him, neither known Him. 7 Little children, let no man deceive you. He that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as He is righteous. 8 He that committeth sin is of the devil, for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil. 9 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for His seed remaineth in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. 10 By this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither is he that loveth not his brother. 11 For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning: that we should love one another. 12 Be not as Cain, who was of that wicked one and slew his brother. And why did he slay him? Because his own works were evil, and his brothers righteous. 13 Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. 14 We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death. 15 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer, and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. 16 Hereby we perceive the love of God: because He laid down His life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. 17 But whoso hath this worlds goods and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up the compassion of his heart from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him? 18 My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth. 19 And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before Him. 20 For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart and knoweth all things. 21 Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then we have confidence toward God. 22 And whatsoever we ask we receive of Him, because we keep His commandment and do those things that are pleasing in His sight. 23 And this is His commandment: that we should believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ and love one another, as He gave us commandment. 24 And he that keepeth His commandments dwelleth in Him, and He in him. And hereby we know that He abideth in us: by the Spirit which He hath given us. "
"Amplified Bible, Classic Edition",AMPC,1 John,4,,"Beloved, do not put faith in every spirit, but prove (test) the spirits to discover whether they proceed from God; for many false prophets have gone forth into the world. 2 By this you may know (perceive and recognize) the Spirit of God: every spirit which acknowledges and confesses [the fact] that Jesus Christ (the Messiah) [actually] has become man and has come in the flesh is of God [has God for its source]; 3 And every spirit which does not acknowledge and confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh [but would [a]annul, destroy, [b]sever, disunite Him] is not of God [does not proceed from Him]. This [[c]nonconfession] is the [spirit] of the antichrist, [of] which you heard that it was coming, and now it is already in the world. 4 Little children, you are of God [you belong to Him] and have [already] defeated and overcome them [the agents of the antichrist], because He Who lives in you is greater (mightier) than he who is in the world. 5 They proceed from the world and are of the world; therefore it is out of the world [its [d]whole economy morally considered] that they speak, and the world listens (pays attention) to them. 6 We are [children] of God. Whoever is learning to know God [progressively to perceive, recognize, and understand God by observation and experience, and to [e]get an ever-clearer knowledge of Him] listens to us; and he who is not of God does not listen or pay attention to us. By this we know (recognize) the Spirit of Truth and the spirit of error. 7 Beloved, let us love one another, for love is (springs) from God; and he who loves [his fellowmen] is begotten (born) of God and is coming [progressively] to know and understand God [to perceive and recognize and get a better and clearer knowledge of Him]. 8 He who does not love has not become acquainted with God [does not and never did know Him], for God is love. 9 In this the love of God was made manifest (displayed) where we are concerned: in that God sent His Son, the only begotten or [f]unique [Son], into the world so that we might live through Him. 10 In this is love: not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation (the atoning sacrifice) for our sins. 11 Beloved, if God loved us so [very much], we also ought to love one another. 12 No man has at any time [yet] seen God. But if we love one another, God abides (lives and remains) in us and His love (that love which is essentially His) is brought to completion (to its full maturity, runs its full course, is perfected) in us! 13 By this we come to know (perceive, recognize, and understand) that we abide (live and remain) in Him and He in us: because He has given (imparted) to us of His [Holy] Spirit. 14 And [besides] we ourselves have seen (have deliberately and steadfastly contemplated) and bear witness that the Father has sent the Son [as the] Savior of the world. 15 Anyone who confesses (acknowledges, owns) that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides (lives, makes His home) in him and he [abides, lives, makes his home] in God. 16 And we know (understand, recognize, are conscious of, by observation and by experience) and believe (adhere to and put faith in and rely on) the love God cherishes for us. God is love, and he who dwells and continues in love dwells and continues in God, and God dwells and continues in him. 17 In this [union and communion with Him] love is brought to completion and attains perfection with us, that we may have confidence for the day of judgment [with assurance and boldness to face Him], because as He is, so are we in this world. 18 There is no fear in love [dread does not exist], but full-grown (complete, perfect) love [g]turns fear out of doors and expels every trace of terror! For fear [h]brings with it the thought of punishment, and [so] he who is afraid has not reached the full maturity of love [is not yet grown into loves complete perfection]. 19 We love Him, because He first loved us. 20 If anyone says, I love God, and hates (detests, abominates) his brother [[i]in Christ], he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, Whom he has not seen. 21 And this command (charge, order, injunction) we have from Him: that he who loves God shall love his brother [[j]believer] also.

BRG Bible,BRG,1 John,1,,"That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life; 2 (For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;) 3 That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. 4 And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full. 5 This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. 6 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth: 7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. 8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.

"Amplified Bible, Classic Edition",AMPC,1 John,1,,"[We are writing] about the Word of Life [[a]in] Him Who existed from the beginning, Whom we have heard, Whom we have seen with our [own] eyes, Whom we have gazed upon [for ourselves] and have touched with our [own] hands. 2 And the Life [[b]an aspect of His being] was revealed (made manifest, demonstrated), and we saw [as eyewitnesses] and are testifying to and declare to you the Life, the eternal Life [[c]in Him] Who already existed with the Father and Who [actually] was made visible (was revealed) to us [His followers]. 3 What we have seen and [ourselves] heard, we are also telling you, so that you too may [d]realize and enjoy fellowship as partners and partakers with us.

American Standard Version,ASV,1 John,5,,"Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is begotten of God: and whosoever loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him. 2 Hereby we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and do his commandments. 3 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous. 4 For whatsoever is begotten of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that hath overcome the world, even our faith. 5 And who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? 6 This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not [a]with the water only, but [b]with the water and [c]with the blood. 7 And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is the truth. 8 For there are three who bear witness, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and the three agree in one. 9 If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for the witness of God is this, that he hath borne witness concerning his Son. 10 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in him: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he hath not believed in the witness that God hath borne concerning his Son. 11 And the witness is this, that God gave unto us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12 He that hath the Son hath the life; he that hath not the Son of God hath not the life. 13 These things have I written unto you, that ye may know that ye have eternal life, even unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God. 14 And this is the boldness which we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us: 15 and if we know that he heareth us whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him. 16 If any man see his brother sinning a sin not unto death, [d]he shall ask, and God will give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is [e]a sin unto death: not concerning this do I say that he should make request. 17 All unrighteousness is sin: and there is [f]a sin not unto death. 18 We know that whosoever is begotten of God sinneth not; but he that was begotten of God keepeth [g]himself, and the evil one toucheth him not. 19 We know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in the evil one. 20 And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life. 21 My little children, guard yourselves from idols. "
21st Century King James Version,KJ21,1 John,2,,"My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. 2 And He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world. 3 And hereby we know that we know Him: if we keep His commandments. 4 He that saith, I know Him, and keepeth not His commandments, is a liar and the truth is not in him. 5 But whoso keepeth His Word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in Him. 6 He that saith that he abideth in Him, ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked. 7 Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the Word which ye have heard from the beginning. 8 Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is past and the true light now shineth. 9 He that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now. 10 He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is no occasion for stumbling in him. 11 But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes. 12 I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for His names sake. 13 I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known Him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father. 14 I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known Him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the Word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one. 15 Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in the world  the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life  is not of the Father, but is of the world. 17 And the world passeth away and the lust thereof, but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever. 18 Little children, it is the last time. And as ye have heard that Antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists, whereby we know that this is the last time. 19 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us. But they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us. 20 But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things. 21 I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth. 22 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist who denieth the Father and the Son. 23 Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father; he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also. 24 Let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son and in the Father. 25 And this is the promise that He hath promised us: even eternal life. 26 These things have I written unto you concerning those who seduce you. 27 But the anointing which ye have received from Him abideth in you, and ye have no need that any man teach you. But as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in Him. 28 And now, little children, abide in Him, that when He shall appear we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before Him at His coming. 29 If ye know that He is righteous, ye know that every one who doeth righteousness is born of Him.

21st Century King James Version,KJ21,1 John,1,,"That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, concerning the Word of Life 2 (for the Life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show unto you that Eternal Life, which was with the Father and was manifested unto us); 3 that which we have seen and heard, declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. 4 And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full. 5 This then is the message which we have heard from Him and declare unto you: that God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all. 6 If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth. 7 But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin. 8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. 9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His Word is not in us. "
BRG Bible,BRG,1 John,2,,"My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: 2 And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world. 3 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. 4 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 5 But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him. 6 He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked. 7 Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning. 8 Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth. 9 He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now. 10 He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him. 11 But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes. 12 I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his names sake. 13 I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father. 14 I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one. 15 Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. 17 And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever. 18 Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time. 19 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us. 20 But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things. 21 I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth. 22 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son. 23 Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: (but) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also. 24 Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father. 25 And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life. 26 These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you. 27 But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him. 28 And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming. 29 If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him. "
American Standard Version,ASV,1 John,4,,"Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets are gone out into the world. 2 Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: 3 and every spirit that [a]confesseth not Jesus is not of God: and this is the spirit of the antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it cometh; and now it is in the world already. 4 Ye are of God, my little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. 5 They are of the world: therefore speak they as of the world, and the world heareth them. 6 We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he who is not of God heareth us not. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error. 7 Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is begotten of God, and knoweth God. 8 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love. 9 Herein was the love of God manifested [b]in us, that God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world that we might live through him. 10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. 11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. 12 No man hath beheld God at any time: if we love one another, God abideth in us, and his love is perfected in us: 13 hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. 14 And we have beheld and bear witness that the Father hath sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world. 15 Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he in God. 16 And we know and have believed the love which God hath [c]in us. God is love; and he that abideth in love abideth in God, and God abideth in him. 17 Herein is love made perfect with us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as he is, even so are we in this world. 18 There is no fear in love: but perfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath punishment; and he that feareth is not made perfect in love. 19 We love, because he first loved us. 20 If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, [d]cannot love God whom he hath not seen. 21 And this commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God love his brother also. "
Amplified Bible,AMP,1 John,3,Children of God Love One Another,"See what an incredible quality of love the Father has shown to us, that we would [be permitted to] be named and called and counted the children of God! And so we are! For this reason the world does not know us, because it did not know Him. 2 Beloved, we are [even here and] now children of God, and it is not yet made clear what we will be [after His coming]. We know that when He comes and is revealed, we will [as His children] be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is [in all His glory]. 3 And everyone who has this hope [confidently placed] in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure (holy, undefiled, guiltless). 4 Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness [ignoring Gods law by action or neglect or by tolerating wrongdoingbeing unrestrained by His commands and His will]. 5 You know that He appeared [in visible form as a man] in order to take away sins; and in Him there is [absolutely] no sin [for He has neither the sin nature nor has He committed sin or acts worthy of blame]. 6 No one who abides in Him [who remains united in fellowship with Himdeliberately, knowingly, and habitually] practices sin. No one who habitually sins has seen Him or known Him. 7 Little children (believers, dear ones), do not let anyone lead you astray. The one who practices righteousness [the one who strives to live a consistently honorable lifein private as well as in publicand to conform to Gods precepts] is righteous, just as He is righteous. 8 The one who practices sin [separating himself from God, and offending Him by acts of disobedience, indifference, or rebellion] is of the devil [and takes his inner character and moral values from him, not God]; for the devil has sinned and violated Gods law from the beginning. The Son of God appeared for this purpose, to destroy the works of the devil. 9 No one who is born of God [deliberately, knowingly, and habitually] practices sin, because [a]Gods seed [His principle of life, the essence of His righteous character] remains [permanently] in him [who is born againwho is reborn from abovespiritually transformed, renewed, and set apart for His purpose]; and he [who is born again] cannot habitually [live a life characterized by] sin, because he is born of God and longs to please Him. 10 By this the children of God and the children of the devil are clearly identified: anyone who does not practice righteousness [who does not seek Gods will in thought, action, and purpose] is not of God, nor is the one who does not [unselfishly] [b]love his [believing] brother. 11 For this is the message which you [believers] have heard from the beginning [of your relationship with Christ], that we should [unselfishly] love and seek the best for one another; 12 and not be like Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother [Abel]. And why did he murder him? Because Cains deeds were evil, and his brothers were righteous. 13 Do not be surprised, believers, if the world hates you. 14 We know that we have passed out of death into Life, because we love the brothers and sisters. He who does not love remains in [spiritual] death. 15 Everyone who hates (works against) his brother [in Christ] is [at heart] a murderer [by Gods standards]; and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. 16 By this we know [and have come to understand the depth and essence of His precious] love: that He [willingly] laid down His life for us [because He loved us]. And we ought to lay down our lives for the believers. 17 But whoever has the [c]worlds goods (adequate resources), and sees his brother in need, but has no compassion for him, how does the love of God live in him? 18 Little children (believers, dear ones), let us not love [merely in theory] with word or with tongue [giving lip service to compassion], but in action and in truth [in practice and in sincerity, because practical acts of love are more than words]. 19 By this we will know [without any doubt] that we are of the truth, and will assure our heart and quiet our conscience before Him 20 whenever our heart convicts us [in guilt]; for God is greater than our heart and He knows all things [nothing is hidden from Him because we are in His hands]. 21 Beloved, if our heart does not convict us [of guilt], we have confidence [complete assurance and boldness] before God; 22 and we receive from Him whatever we ask because we [carefully and consistently] keep His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight [habitually seeking to follow His plan for us]. 23 This is His commandment, that we believe [with personal faith and confident trust] in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and [that we unselfishly] love and seek the best for one another, just as He commanded us. 24 The one who habitually keeps His commandments [obeying His word and following His precepts, abides and] remains in Him, and He in him. By this we know and have the proof that He [really] abides in us, by the Spirit whom He has given us [as a gift]. "
"Amplified Bible, Classic Edition",AMPC,1 John,5,,"Everyone who believes (adheres to, trusts, and relies on the fact) that Jesus is the Christ (the Messiah) is a born-again child of God; and everyone who loves the Father also loves the one born of Him (His offspring). 2 By this we come to know (recognize and understand) that we love the children of God: when we love God and obey His commands (orders, charges)[when we keep His ordinances and are mindful of His precepts and His teaching]. 3 For the [true] love of God is this: that we do His commands [keep His ordinances and are mindful of His precepts and teaching]. And these orders of His are not irksome (burdensome, oppressive, or grievous). 4 For whatever is born of God is victorious over the world; and this is the victory that conquers the world, even our faith. 5 Who is it that is victorious over [that conquers] the world but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God [who adheres to, trusts in, and relies on that fact]? 6 This is He Who came by (with) water and blood [[a]His baptism and His death], Jesus Christ (the Messiah)not by (in) the water only, but by (in) the water and the blood. And it is the [Holy] Spirit Who bears witness, because the [Holy] Spirit is the Truth. 7 So there are three witnesses [b]in heaven: the Father, the Word and the Holy Spirit, and these three are One; 8 and there are three witnesses on the earth: the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three agree [are in unison; their testimony coincides]. 9 If we accept [as we do] the testimony of men [if we are willing to take human authority], the testimony of God is greater (of stronger authority), for this is the testimony of God, even the witness which He has borne regarding His Son. 10 He who believes in the Son of God [who adheres to, trusts in, and relies on Him] has the testimony [possesses this divine attestation] within himself. He who does not believe God [in this way] has made Him out to be and represented Him as a liar, because he has not believed (put his faith in, adhered to, and relied on) the evidence (the testimony) that God has borne regarding His Son. 11 And this is that testimony (that evidence): God gave us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. 12 He who possesses the Son has that life; he who does not possess the Son of God does not have that life. 13 I write this to you who believe in (adhere to, trust in, and rely on) the name of the Son of God [in [c]the peculiar services and blessings conferred by Him on men], so that you may know [with settled and absolute knowledge] that you [already] have life, [d]yes, eternal life. 14 And this is the confidence (the assurance, the privilege of boldness) which we have in Him: [we are sure] that if we ask anything (make any request) according to His will (in agreement with His own plan), He listens to and hears us. 15 And if (since) we [positively] know that He listens to us in whatever we ask, we also know [with settled and absolute knowledge] that we have [granted us as our present possessions] the requests made of Him. 16 If anyone sees his brother [believer] committing a sin that does not [lead to] death (the extinguishing of life), he will pray and [God] will give him life [yes, He will grant life to all those whose sin is not one leading to death]. There is a sin [that leads] to death; I do not say that one should pray for that. 17 All wrongdoing is sin, and there is sin which does not [involve] death [that may be repented of and forgiven]. 18 We know [absolutely] that anyone born of God does not [deliberately and knowingly] practice committing sin, but the One Who was begotten of God carefully watches over and protects him [Christs divine presence within him preserves him against the evil], and the wicked one does not lay hold (get a grip) on him or touch [him]. 19 We know [positively] that we are of God, and the whole world [around us] is under the power of the evil one. 20 And we [have seen and] know [positively] that the Son of God has [actually] come to this world and has given us understanding and insight [progressively] to perceive (recognize) and come to know better and more clearly Him Who is true; and we are in Him Who is truein His Son Jesus Christ (the Messiah). This [Man] is the true God and Life eternal. 21 Little children, keep yourselves from idols (false gods)[from anything and everything that would occupy the place in your heart due to God, from any sort of substitute for Him that would take first place in your life]. Amen (so let it be). "
BRG Bible,BRG,1 John,5,,"Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him. 2 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments. 3 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous. 4 For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. 5 Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? 6 This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth. 7 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. 8 And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one. 9 If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son. 10 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. 11 And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12 He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. 13 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. 14 And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us: 15 And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him. 16 If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it. 17 All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death. 18 We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not. 19 And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness. 20 And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life. 21 Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen. "
Christian Standard Bible,CSB,1 John,4,The Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Error,"Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see if they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 This is how you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,(C) 3 but every spirit that does not confess Jesus[a] is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming; even now it is already in the world. 4 You are from God, little children, and you have conquered them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.(F) 5 They are from the world. Therefore what they say is from the world, and the world listens to them. 6 We are from God. Anyone who knows God listens to us; anyone who is not from God does not listen to us. This is how we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deception.(I) 7 Dear friends, let us love one another, because love is from God, and everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. 8 The one who does not love does not know God, because God is love. 9 Gods love was revealed among us[b] in this way: God sent his one and only Son(L) into the world so that we might live(M) through him. 10 Love consists in this: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice[c](O) for our sins. 11 Dear friends, if God loved us in this way, we also must love one another. 12 No one has ever seen God. If we love one another, God remains in[d] us and his love is made complete in us. 13 This is how we know that we remain in him and he in us: He has given us of his Spirit.(S) 14 And we have seen and we testify that the Father has sent his Son as the worlds Savior. 15 Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of GodGod remains in him and he in God. 16 And we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and the one who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him. 17 In this, love is made complete with us so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment, because as he is, so also are we in this world.(W) 18 There is no fear in love; instead, perfect love drives out fear, because fear involves punishment.[e] So the one who fears is not complete in love.(Y) 19 We love[f] because he first loved us. 20 If anyone says, I love God, and yet hates his brother or sister, he is a liar.(AB) For the person who does not love his brother or sister(AC) whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen.[g] 21 And we have this command from him: The one who loves God must also love his brother and sister. "
Christian Standard Bible,CSB,1 John,5,The Certainty of Gods Testimony,"Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father[a] also loves the one born of him. 2 This is how we know that we love Gods children: when we love God and obey[b] his commands. 3 For this is what love for God is: to keep his commands. And his commands are not a burden, 4 because everyone who has been born of God conquers the world. This is the victory that has conquered the world: our faith. 5 Who is the one who conquers the world but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?(D) 6 Jesus Christhe is the one who came by water and blood, not by water only, but by water and by blood.(F) And the Spirit is the one who testifies,(G) because the Spirit is the truth. 7 For there are three that testify:[c] 8 the Spirit, the water, and the blood(J)and these three are in agreement. 9 If we accept human testimony, Gods testimony is greater, because it is Gods testimony that he has given about his Son. 10 The one who believes in the Son of God has this testimony within himself. The one who does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony God has given about his Son. 11 And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12 The one who has the Son has life. The one who does not have the Son of God does not have life. 13 I have written these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life. 14 This is the confidence we have before him: If we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.(P) 15 And if we know that he hears whatever we ask, we know that we have what we have asked of him.(R) 16 If anyone sees a fellow believer[d] committing a sin that doesnt lead to death, he should ask, and God will give life to himto those who commit sin that doesnt lead to death. There is sin[e] that leads to death. I am not saying he should pray about that. 17 All unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin that doesnt lead to death. 18 We know that everyone who has been born of God does not sin, but the one who is born of God keeps him,[f] and the evil one does not touch him. 19 We know that we are of God, and the whole world is under the sway of the evil one. 20 And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding so that we may know the true one.[g] We are in the true onethat is, in his Son, Jesus Christ.(U) He is the true God and eternal life. 21 Little children, guard yourselves from idols. "
Christian Standard Bible,CSB,1 John,3,Love in Action,"See what great love[a] the Father has given us that we should be called Gods childrenand we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it didnt know him. 2 Dear friends, we are Gods children now, and what we will be has not yet been revealed. We know that when he appears,[b] we will be like him(B) because we will see him as he is.(C) 3 And everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself just as he is pure.(E) 4 Everyone who commits sin practices lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness. 5 You know that he was revealed so that he might take away sins,[c] and there is no sin in him.(G) 6 Everyone who remains in him does not sin;[d](I) everyone who sins[e] has not seen him or known him. 7 Little children, let no one deceive you. The one who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous. 8 The one who commits[f] sin is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. The Son of God was revealed(K) for this purpose: to destroy the devils works. 9 Everyone who has been born of God does not sin,[g] because his seed(M) remains in him; he is not able to sin,[h] because he has been born of God. 10 This is how Gods children and the devils children become obvious. Whoever does not do what is right is not of God, especially the one who does not love his brother or sister. 11 For this is the message you have heard from the beginning: We should love one another, 12 unlike Cain, who was of the evil one(P) and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his deeds were evil, and his brothers were righteous. 13 Do not be surprised, brothers and sisters, if the world hates you. 14 We know that we have passed from death to life because we love our brothers and sisters. The one who does not love remains in death. 15 Everyone who hates his brother or sister is a murderer,(T) and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in him. 16 This is how we have come to know love: He laid down his life for us.(V) We should also lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters.(W) 17 If anyone has this worlds goods and sees a fellow believer[i] in need(Y) but withholds compassion(Z) from himhow does Gods love reside in him?(AA) 18 Little children, let us not love in word or speech, but in action and in truth. 19 This is how we will know that we belong to the truth and will reassure our hearts before him 20 whenever our hearts condemn us; for God is greater than our hearts, and he knows all things. 21 Dear friends, if our hearts dont condemn us, we have confidence before God 22 and receive whatever we ask from him because we keep his commands and do what is pleasing in his sight. 23 Now this is his command: that we believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another as he commanded us. 24 The one who keeps his commands remains in him, and he in him. And the way we know that he remains in us(AH) is from the Spirit(AI) he has given us. "
BRG Bible,BRG,1 John,4,,"Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. 2 Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: 3 And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world. 4 Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. 5 They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them. 6 We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the Spirit of truth, and the spirit of error. 7 Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. 8 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love. 9 In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. 10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. 11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. 12 No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us. 13 Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. 14 And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world. 15 Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. 16 And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. 17 Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world. 18 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love. 19 We love him, because he first loved us. 20 If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? 21 And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.

Christian Standard Bible,CSB,1 John,1,Prologue: Our Declaration,"What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have observed and have touched with our hands, concerning the word(B) of life 2 that life was revealed, and we have seen it and we testify and declare to you the eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us(D) 3 what we have seen and heard we also declare to you, so that you may also have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father(F) and with his Son, Jesus Christ. 4 We are writing these things[a] so that our[b] joy may be complete. 5 This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light, and there is absolutely no darkness in him.(I) 6 If we say, We have fellowship with him, and yet we walk in darkness,(K) we are lying and are not practicing the truth.(L) 7 If we walk in the light as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus(N) his Son cleanses us from all sin. 8 If we say, We have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 10 If we say, We have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.(R) "
Christian Standard Bible,CSB,1 John,2,Gods Commands,"My little children, I am writing you these things so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the FatherJesus Christ the righteous one. 2 He himself is the atoning sacrifice[a] for our sins, and not only for ours, but also for those of the whole world.(C) 3 This is how we know that we know him: if we keep his commands.(E) 4 The one who says, I have come to know him, and yet doesnt keep his commands, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 5 But whoever keeps his word, truly in him the love of God is made complete. This is how we know we are in him:(G) 6 The one who says he remains in him should walk just as he walked. 7 Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old command that you have had from the beginning. The old command is the word(J) you have heard. 8 Yet I am writing you a new command, which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light(L) is already shining.(M) 9 The one who says he is in the light but hates his brother or sister is in the darkness until now. 10 The one who loves his brother or sister remains in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling in him.[b] 11 But the one who hates his brother or sister is in the darkness, walks in the darkness,(Q) and doesnt know where hes going,(R) because the darkness has blinded his eyes. 12 I am writing to you, little children, since your sins have been forgiven on account of his name. 13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you have come to know the one who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have conquered the evil one. 14 I have written to you, children, because you have come to know the Father. I have written to you, fathers, because you have come to know the one who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, Gods word remains in you, and you have conquered the evil one. 15 Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For everything in the worldthe lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes,(Y) and the pride(Z) in ones possessionsis not from the Father, but is from the world. 17 And the world with its lust is passing away, but the one who does the will of God(AB) remains forever.(AC) 18 Children, it is the last hour. And as you have heard that antichrist(AE) is coming, even now many antichrists have come. By this we know that it is the last hour. 19 They went out from us, but they did not belong to us; for if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us. However, they went out so that it might be made clear that none of them belongs to us. 20 But you have an anointing from the Holy One,(AG) and all of you know the truth.[c] 21 I have not written to you because you dont know the truth, but because you do know it, and because no lie comes from the truth. 22 Who is the liar, if not the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This one is the antichrist: the one who denies the Father and the Son. 23 No one who denies the Son has the Father; he who confesses the Son has the Father as well.(AJ) 24 What you have heard from the beginning is to remain in you. If what you have heard from the beginning remains in you, then you will remain in the Son and in the Father.(AL) 25 And this is the promise that he himself made to us: eternal life. 26 I have written these things to you concerning those who are trying to deceive you. 27 As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you dont need anyone to teach you. Instead, his anointing teaches you about all things and is true and is not a lie; just as it has taught you,[d] remain in him.(AO) 28 So now, little children, remain in him so that when he appears we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming.(AQ) 29 If you know that he is righteous, you know this as well: Everyone who does what is right has been born of him.(AS) "
Complete Jewish Bible,CJB,1 John,4,,"Dear friends, dont trust every spirit. On the contrary, test the spirits to see whether they are from God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 Here is how you recognize the Spirit of God: every spirit which acknowledges that Yeshua the Messiah came as a human being is from God, 3 and every spirit which does not acknowledge Yeshua is not from God  in fact, this is the spirit of the Anti-Messiah. You have heard that he is coming. Well, hes here now, in the world already! 4 You, children, are from God and have overcome the false prophets, because he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world. 5 They are from the world; therefore, they speak from the worlds viewpoint; and the world listens to them. 6 We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God doesnt listen to us. This is how we distinguish the Spirit of truth from the spirit of error. 7 Beloved friends, let us love one another; because love is from God; and everyone who loves has God as his Father and knows God. 8 Those who do not love, do not know God; because God is love. 9 Here is how God showed his love among us: God sent his only Son into the world, so that through him we might have life. 10 Here is what love is: not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the kapparah for our sins. 11 Beloved friends, if this is how God loved us, we likewise ought to love one another. 12 No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God remains united with us, and our love for him has been brought to its goal in us. 13 Here is how we know that we remain united with him and he with us: he has given to us from his own Spirit. 14 Moreover, we have seen and we testify that the Father has sent his Son as Deliverer of the world. 15 If someone acknowledges that Yeshua is the Son of God, God remains united with him, and he with God. 16 Also we have come to know and trust the love that God has for us. God is love; and those who remain in this love remain united with God, and God remains united with them. 17 Here is how love has been brought to maturity with us: as the Messiah is, so are we in the world. This gives us confidence for the Day of Judgment. 18 There is no fear in love. On the contrary, love that has achieved its goal gets rid of fear, because fear has to do with punishment; the person who keeps fearing has not been brought to maturity in regard to love. 19 We ourselves love now because he loved us first. 20 If anyone says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar. For if a person does not love his brother, whom he has seen, then he cannot love God, whom he has not seen. 21 Yes, this is the command we have from him: whoever loves God must love his brother too. "
Common English Bible,CEB,1 John,4,Testing the spirits,"Dear friends, dont believe every spirit. Test the spirits to see if they are from God because many false prophets have gone into the world. 2 This is how you know if a spirit comes from God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come as a human[a] is from God, 3 and every spirit that doesnt confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and is now already in the world. 4 You are from God, little children, and you have defeated these people because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. 5 They are from the world. So they speak from the worlds point of view and the world listens to them. 6 We are from God. The person who knows God listens to us. Whoever is not from God doesnt listen to us. This is how we recognize the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error. 7 Dear friends, lets love each other, because love is from God, and everyone who loves is born from God and knows God. 8 The person who doesnt love does not know God, because God is love. 9 This is how the love of God is revealed to us: God has sent his only Son into the world so that we can live through him. 10 This is love: it is not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son as the sacrifice that deals with our sins. 11 Dear friends, if God loved us this way, we also ought to love each other. 12 No one has ever seen God. If we love each other, God remains in us and his love is made perfect in us. 13 This is how we know we remain in him and he remains in us, because he has given us a measure of his Spirit. 14 We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the savior of the world. 15 If any of us confess that Jesus is Gods Son, God remains in us and we remain in God. 16 We have known and have believed the love that God has for us. God is love, and those who remain in love remain in God and God remains in them. 17 This is how love has been perfected in us, so that we can have confidence on the Judgment Day, because we are exactly the same as God is in this world. 18 There is no fear in love, but perfect love drives out fear, because fear expects punishment. The person who is afraid has not been made perfect in love. 19 We love because God first loved us. 20 Those who say, I love God and hate their brothers or sisters are liars. After all, those who dont love their brothers or sisters whom they have seen can hardly love God whom they have not seen! 21 This commandment we have from him: Those who claim to love God ought to love their brother and sister also. "
Complete Jewish Bible,CJB,1 John,3,,"See what love the Father has lavished on us in letting us be called Gods children! For that is what we are. The reason the world does not know us is that it has not known him. 2 Dear friends, we are Gods children now; and it has not yet been made clear what we will become. We do know that when he appears, we will be like him; because we will see him as he really is. 3 And everyone who has this hope in him continues purifying himself, since God is pure. 4 Everyone who keeps sinning is violating Torah  indeed, sin is violation of Torah. 5 You know that he appeared in order to take away sins, and that there is no sin in him. 6 So no one who remains united with him continues sinning; everyone who does continue sinning has neither seen him nor known him. 7 Children, dont let anyone deceive you  it is the person that keeps on doing what is right who is righteous, just as God is righteous. 8 The person who keeps on sinning is from the Adversary, because from the very beginning the Adversary has kept on sinning. It was for this very reason that the Son of God appeared, to destroy these doings of the Adversary. 9 No one who has God as his Father keeps on sinning, because the seed planted by God remains in him. That is, he cannot continue sinning, because he has God as his Father. 10 Here is how one can distinguish clearly between Gods children and those of the Adversary: everyone who does not continue doing what is right is not from God. Likewise, anyone who fails to keep loving his brother is not from God. 11 For this is the message which you have heard from the beginning: that we should love each other 12 and not be like Kayin, who was from the Evil One and murdered his own brother. Why did he murder him? Because his own actions were evil, and his brothers were righteous. 13 Dont be amazed, brothers, if the world hates you. 14 We, for our part, know that we have passed from death to life because we keep loving the brothers. The person who fails to keep on loving is still under the power of death. 15 Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life in him. 16 The way that we have come to know love is through his having laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers! 17 If someone has worldly possessions and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how can he be loving God? 18 Children, let us love not with words and talk, but with actions and in reality! 19 Here is how we will know that we are from the truth and will set our hearts at rest in his presence: 20 if our hearts know something against us, God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything. 21 Dear friends, if our hearts know nothing against us, we have confidence in approaching God; 22 then, whatever we ask for, we receive from him; because we are obeying his commands and doing the things that please him. 23 This is his command: that we are to trust in the person and power of his Son Yeshua the Messiah and to keep loving one another, just as he commanded us. 24 Those who obey his commands remain united with him and he with them. Here is how we know that he remains united with us: by the Spirit whom he gave us. "
Common English Bible,CEB,1 John,3,Practicing sin or righteousness,"See what kind of love the Father has given to us in that we should be called Gods children, and that is what we are! Because the world didnt recognize him, it doesnt recognize us. 2 Dear friends, now we are Gods children, and it hasnt yet appeared what we will be. We know that when he appears we will be like him because well see him as he is. 3 And all who have this hope in him purify themselves even as he is pure. 4 Every person who practices sin commits an act of rebellion, and sin is rebellion. 5 You know that he appeared to take away sins, and there is no sin in him. 6 Every person who remains in relationship to him does not sin. Any person who sins has not seen him or known him. 7 Little children, make sure no one deceives you. The person who practices righteousness is righteous, in the same way that Jesus is righteous. 8 The person who practices sin belongs to the devil, because the devil has been sinning since the beginning. Gods Son appeared for this purpose: to destroy the works of the devil. 9 Those born from God dont practice sin because Gods DNA[a] remains in them. They cant sin because they are born from God. 10 This is how Gods children and the devils children are apparent: everyone who doesnt practice righteousness is not from God, including the person who doesnt love a brother or sister. 11 This is the message that you heard from the beginning: love each other. 12 Dont behave like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he kill him? He killed him because his own works were evil, but the works of his brother were righteous. 13 Dont be surprised, brothers and sisters, if the world hates you. 14 We know that we have transferred from death to life, because we love the brothers and sisters. The person who does not love remains in death. 15 Everyone who hates a brother or sister is a murderer, and you know that murderers dont have eternal life residing in them. 16 This is how we know love: Jesus laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters. 17 But if someone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but refuses to helphow can the love of God dwell in a person like that? 18 Little children, lets not love with words or speech but with action and truth. 19 This is how we will know that we belong to the truth and reassure our hearts in Gods presence. 20 Even if our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts and knows all things. 21 Dear friends, if our hearts dont condemn us, we have confidence in relationship to God. 22 We receive whatever we ask from him because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him. 23 This is his commandment, that we believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love each other as he commanded us. 24 Those who keep his commandments dwell in God and God dwells in them. This is how we know that he dwells in us, because of the Spirit he has given us. "
Common English Bible,CEB,1 John,2,Living in the light,"My little children, Im writing these things to you so that you dont sin. But if you do sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous one. 2 He is Gods way of dealing with our sins, not only ours but the sins of the whole world. 3 This is how we know that we know him: if we keep his commandments. 4 The one who claims, I know him, while not keeping his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in this person. 5 But the love of God is truly perfected in whoever keeps his word. This is how we know we are in him. 6 The one who claims to remain in him ought to live in the same way as he lived. 7 Dear friends, Im not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment that you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the message you heard. 8 On the other hand, I am writing a new commandment to you, which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light already shines. 9 The one who claims to be in the light while hating a brother or sister is in the darkness even now. 10 The person loving a brother and sister stays in the light, and there is nothing in the light that causes a person to stumble. 11 But the person who hates a brother or sister is in the darkness and lives in the darkness, and doesnt know where to go because the darkness blinds the eyes. 12 Little children, Im writing to you because your sins have been forgiven through Jesus name. 13 Parents, Im writing to you because you have known the one who has existed from the beginning. Young people, Im writing to you because you have conquered the evil one. 14 Little children, I write to you because you know the Father. Parents, I write to you because you have known the one who has existed from the beginning. Young people, I write to you because you are strong, the word of God remains in you, and you have conquered the evil one. 15 Dont love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in them. 16 Everything that is in the worldthe craving for whatever the body feels, the craving for whatever the eyes see and the arrogant pride in ones possessionsis not of the Father but is of the world. 17 And the world and its cravings are passing away, but the person who does the will of God remains forever. 18 Little children, it is the last hour. Just as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have appeared. This is how we know it is the last hour. 19 They went out from us, but they were not really part of us. If they had been part of us, they would have stayed with us. But by going out from us, they showed they all are not part of us. 20 But you have an anointing from the holy one, and all of you know the truth. 21 I dont write to you because you dont know the truth but because you know it. You know that no lie comes from the truth. 22 Who is the liar? Isnt it the person who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This person is the antichrist: the one who denies the Father and the Son. 23 Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father, but the one who confesses the Son has the Father also. 24 As for you, what you heard from the beginning must remain in you. If what you heard from the beginning remains in you, you will also remain in relationship to the Son and in the Father. 25 This is the promise that he himself gave us: eternal life. 26 I write these things to you about those who are attempting to deceive you. 27 As for you, the anointing that you received from him remains on you, and you dont need anyone to teach you the truth. But since his anointing teaches you about all things (its true and not a lie), remain in relationship to him just as he taught you. 28 And now, little children, remain in relationship to Jesus, so that when he appears we can have confidence and not be ashamed in front of him when he comes. 29 If you know that he is righteous, you also know that every person who practices righteousness is born from him.

Complete Jewish Bible,CJB,1 John,1,,"The Word, which gives life! He existed from the beginning. We have heard him, we have seen him with our eyes, we have contemplated him, we have touched him with our hands! 2 The life appeared, and we have seen it. We are testifying to it and announcing it to you  eternal life! He was with the Father, and he appeared to us. 3 What we have seen and heard, we are proclaiming to you; so that you too may have fellowship with us. Our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Yeshua the Messiah. 4 We are writing these things so that our joy may be complete. 5 And this is the message which we have heard from him and proclaim to you: God is light, and there is no darkness in him  none! 6 If we claim to have fellowship with him while we are walking in the darkness, we are lying and not living out the truth. 7 But if we are walking in the light, as he is in the light, then we have fellowship with each other, and the blood of his Son Yeshua purifies us from all sin. 8 If we claim not to have sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 9 If we acknowledge our sins, then, since he is trustworthy and just, he will forgive them and purify us from all wrongdoing. 10 If we claim we have not been sinning, we are making him out to be a liar, and his Word is not in us.

Complete Jewish Bible,CJB,1 John,5,,"Everyone who believes that Yeshua is the Messiah has God as his father, and everyone who loves a father loves his offspring too. 2 Here is how we know that we love Gods children: when we love God, we also do what he commands. 3 For loving God means obeying his commands. Moreover, his commands are not burdensome, 4 because everything which has God as its Father overcomes the world. And this is what victoriously overcomes the world: our trust. 5 Who does overcome the world if not the person who believes that Yeshua is the Son of God? 6 He is the one who came by means of water and blood, Yeshua the Messiah  not with water only, but with the water and the blood. And the Spirit bears witness, because the Spirit is the truth. 7 There are three witnesses  8 the Spirit, the water and the blood  and these three are in agreement. 9 If we accept human witness, Gods witness is stronger, because it is the witness which God has given about his Son. 10 Those who keep trusting in the Son of God have this witness in them. Those who do not keep trusting God have made him out to be a liar, because they have not trusted in the witness which God has given about his Son. 11 And this is the witness: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12 Those who have the Son have the life; those who do not have the Son of God do not have the life. 13 I have written you these things so that you may know that you have eternal life  you who keep trusting in the person and power of the Son of God. 14 This is the confidence we have in his presence: if we ask anything that accords with his will, he hears us. 15 And if we know that he hears us  whatever we ask  then we know that we have what we have asked from him. 16 If anyone sees his brother committing a sin that does not lead to death, he will ask; and God will give him life for those whose sinning does not lead to death. There is sin that does lead to death; I am not saying he should pray about that. 17 All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that does not lead to death. 18 We know that everyone who has God as his Father does not go on sinning; on the contrary, the Son born of God protects him, and the Evil One does not touch him. 19 We know that we are from God, and that the whole world lies in the power of the Evil One. 20 And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us discernment, so that we may know who is genuine; moreover, we are united with the One who is genuine, united with his Son Yeshua the Messiah. He is the genuine God and eternal life. 21 Children, guard yourselves against false gods! "
Darby Translation,DARBY,1 John,3,,"See what love the Father has given to us, that we should be called [the] children of God. For this reason the world knows us not, because it knew him not. 2 Beloved, now are we children of God, and what we shall be has not yet been manifested; we know that if it is manifested we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. 3 And every one that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as *he* is pure. 4 Every one that practises sin practises also lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness. 5 And ye know that *he* has been manifested that he might take away our sins; and in him sin is not. 6 Whoever abides in him, does not sin: whoever sins, has not seen him or known him. 7 Children, let no man lead you astray; he that practises righteousness is righteous, even as *he* is righteous. 8 He that practises sin is of the devil; for from [the] beginning the devil sins. To this end the Son of God has been manifested, that he might undo the works of the devil. 9 Whoever has been begotten of God does not practise sin, because his seed abides in him, and he cannot sin, because he has been begotten of God. 10 In this are manifest the children of God and the children of the devil. Whoever does not practise righteousness is not of God, and he who does not love his brother. 11 For this is the message which ye have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another: 12 not as Cain was of the wicked one, and slew his brother; and on account of what slew he him? because his works were wicked, and those of his brother righteous. 13 Do not wonder, brethren, if the world hate you. 14 *We* know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love [his] brother abides in death. 15 Every one that hates his brother is a murderer, and ye know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. 16 Hereby we have known love, because *he* has laid down his life for us; and *we* ought for the brethren to lay down [our] lives. 17 But whoso may have the world's substance, and see his brother having need, and shut up his bowels from him, how abides the love of God in him? 18 Children, let us not love with word, nor with tongue, but in deed and in truth. 19 And hereby we shall know that we are of the truth, and shall persuade our hearts before him 20 that if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart and knows all things. 21 Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have boldness towards God, 22 and whatsoever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments, and practise the things which are pleasing in his sight. 23 And this is his commandment, that we believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and that we love one another, even as he has given us commandment. 24 And he that keeps his commandments abides in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit which he has given to us. "
Contemporary English Version,CEV,1 John,2,Christ Helps Us,"My children, I am writing this so you won't sin. But if you do sin, Jesus Christ always does the right thing, and he will speak to the Father for us. 2 Christ is the sacrifice that takes away our sins and the sins of all the world's people. 3 When we obey God, we are sure we know him. 4 But if we claim to know him and don't obey him, we are lying and the truth isn't in our hearts. 5 We truly love God only when we obey him as we should, and then we know we belong to him. 6 If we say we are his, we must follow the example of Christ. 7 My dear friends, I am not writing to give you a new commandment. It is the same one you were first given, and it is the message you heard. 8 But it really is a new commandment, and you know its true meaning, just as Christ does. You can see the darkness fading away and the true light already shining. 9 If we claim to be in the light and hate someone, we are still in the dark. 10 But if we love others, we are in the light, and we don't cause problems for them.[a] 11 If we hate others, we are living and walking in the dark. We don't know where we are going, because we can't see in the dark. 12 Children, I am writing you, because your sins have been forgiven in the name of Christ. 13 Parents, I am writing you, because you have known the one who was there from the beginning. Young people, I am writing you, because you have defeated the evil one. 14 Children, I am writing you, because you have known the Father. Parents, I am writing you, because you have known the one who was there from the beginning. Young people, I am writing you, because you are strong. God's message is firm in your hearts, and you have defeated the evil one. 15 Don't love the world or anything that belongs to the world. If you love the world, you cannot love the Father. 16 Our foolish pride comes from this world, and so do our selfish desires and our desire to have everything we see. None of this comes from the Father. 17 The world and the desires it causes are disappearing. But if we obey God, we will live forever. 18 Children, this is the last hour. You heard that the enemy of Christ would appear at this time, and many of Christ's enemies have already appeared. So we know the last hour is here. 19 These people came from our own group, yet they were not really part of us. If they had been part of us, they would have stayed with us. But they left, which proves they did not belong to our group. 20 Christ, the Holy One,[b] has blessed[c] you, and now all of you understand.[d] 21 I did not need to write you about the truth, since you already know it. You also know that liars do not belong to the truth. 22 And a liar is anyone who says Jesus isn't truly Christ. Anyone who says this is an enemy of Christ and rejects both the Father and the Son. 23 If we reject the Son, we reject the Father. But if we say we accept the Son, we have the Father. 24 Keep thinking about the message you first heard, and you will always be one in your heart with the Son and with the Father. 25 The Son[e] has promised us[f] eternal life. 26 I am writing to warn you about those people who are misleading you. 27 But Christ has blessed you with the Holy Spirit.[g] Now the Spirit stays in you, and you don't need any teachers. The Spirit is truthful and teaches you everything. So stay one in your heart with Christ, just as the Spirit has taught you to do. 28 Children, stay one in your hearts with Christ. Then when he returns, we will have confidence and won't have to hide in shame. 29 You know Christ always does right and everyone who does right is a child of God. "
Contemporary English Version,CEV,1 John,3,Love Each Other,"Think how much the Father loves us. He loves us so much that he lets us be called his children, as we truly are. But since the people of this world did not know who Christ[a] is, they don't know who we are. 2 My dear friends, we are already God's children, though what we will be hasn't yet been seen. But we do know when Christ returns, we will be like him, because we will see him as he truly is. 3 This hope makes us keep ourselves holy, just as Christ[b] is holy. 4 Everyone who sins breaks God's law, because sin is the same as breaking God's law. 5 You know Christ came to take away our sins. He isn't sinful, 6 and people who stay one in their hearts with him won't keep on sinning. If they do keep on sinning, they don't know Christ, and they have never seen him. 7 Children, don't be fooled. Anyone who does right is good, just like Christ himself. 8 Anyone who keeps on sinning belongs to the devil. He has sinned from the beginning, but the Son of God came to destroy all that he has done. 9 God's children cannot keep on being sinful. His life-giving power[c] lives in them and makes them his children, so they cannot keep on sinning. 10 You can tell God's children from the devil's children, because those who belong to the devil refuse to do right or to love each other. 11 From the beginning you were told we must love each other. 12 Don't be like Cain, who belonged to the devil and murdered his own brother. Why did he murder him? He did it because his brother was good, and he was evil. 13 My friends, don't be surprised if the people of this world hate you. 14 Our love for each other proves we have gone from death to life. But if you don't love each other, you are still under the power of death. 15 If you hate each other, you are murderers, and we know murderers do not have eternal life. 16 We know what love is because Jesus gave his life for us. This is why we must give our lives for each other. 17 If we have all we need and see one of our own people in need, we must have pity on that person, or else we cannot say we love God. 18 Children, you show love for others by truly helping them, and not merely by talking about it. 19 When we love others, we know we belong to the truth, and we feel at ease in the presence of God. 20 But even if we don't feel at ease, God is greater than our feelings, and he knows everything. 21 Dear friends, if we feel at ease in the presence of God, we will have the courage to come near him. 22 He will give us whatever we ask, because we obey him and do what pleases him. 23 God wants us to have faith in his Son Jesus Christ and to love each other. This is also what Jesus taught us to do. 24 If we obey God's commandments, we will stay one in our hearts with him, and he will stay one with us. The Spirit he has given us is proof that we are one with him. "
Complete Jewish Bible,CJB,1 John,2,,"My children, I am writing you these things so that you wont sin. But if anyone does sin, we have Yeshua the Messiah, the Tzaddik, who pleads our cause with the Father. 2 Also, he is the kapparah for our sins  and not only for ours, but also for those of the whole world. 3 The way we can be sure we know him is if we are obeying his commands. 4 Anyone who says, I know him, but isnt obeying his commands is a liar  the truth is not in him. 5 But if someone keeps doing what he says, then truly love for God has been brought to its goal in him. This is how we are sure that we are united with him. 6 A person who claims to be continuing in union with him ought to conduct his life the way he did. 7 Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command. On the contrary, it is an old command, which you have had from the beginning; the old command is the message which you have heard before. 8 Yet I am writing you a new command, and its reality is seen both in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining. 9 Anyone who claims to be in this light while hating his brother is still in the dark. 10 The person who keeps loving his brother remains in the light, and there is nothing in him that could make him trip. 11 But the person who hates his brother is in the dark  yes, he is walking in the dark, and he doesnt know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes. 12 You children, I am writing you because your sins have been forgiven for his sake. 13 You fathers, I am writing you because you have known him who has existed from the beginning. You young people, I am writing you because you have overcome the Evil One. 14 You children, I have written you because you have known the Father. You fathers, I have written you because you have known him who has existed from the beginning. You young people, I have written you because you are strong  the Word of God remains in you, and you have overcome the Evil One. 15 Do not love the world or the things of the world. If someone loves the world, then love for the Father is not in him; 16 because all the things of the world  the desires of the old nature, the desires of the eyes, and the pretensions of life  are not from the Father but from the world. 17 And the world is passing away, along with its desires. But whoever does Gods will remains forever. 18 Children, this is the Last Hour. You have heard that an Anti-Messiah is coming; and in fact, many anti-Messiahs have arisen now  which is how we know that this is the Last Hour. 19 They went out from us, but they werent part of us; for had they been part of us, they would have remained with us. 20 But you have received the Messiahs anointing from HaKadosh, and you know all this. 21 It is not because you dont know the truth that I have written to you, but because you do know it, and because no lie has its origin in the truth. 22 Who is a liar at all, if not the person who denies that Yeshua is the Messiah? Such a person is an anti-Messiah  he is denying the Father and the Son. 23 Everyone who denies the Son is also without the Father, but the person who acknowledges the Son has the Father as well. 24 Let what you heard from the beginning remain in you. If what you heard from the beginning remains in you, you will also remain in union with both the Son and the Father. 25 And this is what he has promised us: eternal life. 26 I have written you these things about the people who are trying to deceive you. 27 As for you, the Messianic anointing you received from the Father remains in you, so that you have no need for anyone to teach you. On the contrary, as his Messianic anointing continues to teach you about all things, and is true, not a counterfeit, so, just as he taught you, remain united with him. 28 And now, children, remain united with him; so that when he appears, we may have confidence and not shrink back from him in shame at his coming. 29 If you know that he is righteous, you should also know that he is the Father of everyone who does what is right. "
Contemporary English Version,CEV,1 John,5,Victory over the World,"If we believe Jesus is truly Christ, we are God's children. Everyone who loves the Father will also love his children. 2 If we love and obey God, we know we will love his children. 3 We show our love for God by obeying his commandments, and they are not hard to follow. 4 Every child of God can defeat the world, and our faith is what gives us this victory. 5 No one can defeat the world without having faith in Jesus as the Son of God. 6 Water and blood came out from the side of Jesus Christ. It wasn't just water, but water and blood.[a] The Spirit tells about this, because the Spirit is truthful. 7 In fact, there are three who tell about it. 8 They are the Spirit, the water, and the blood, and they all agree. 9 We believe what people tell us. But we can trust what God says even more, and God is the one who has spoken about his Son. 10 If we have faith in God's Son, we have believed what God has said. But if we don't believe what God has said about his Son, it is the same as calling God a liar. 11 God has also said he gave us eternal life and this life comes to us from his Son. 12 And so, if we have God's Son, we have this life. But if we don't have the Son, we don't have this life. 13 All of you have faith in the Son of God, and I have written to let you know you have eternal life. 14 We are certain God will hear our prayers when we ask for what pleases him. 15 And if we know God listens when we pray, we are sure our prayers have already been answered. 16 Suppose you see one of our people commit a sin that isn't a deadly sin. You can pray, and this person will be given eternal life. But the sin must not be one that is deadly. 17 Everything that is wrong is sin, but not all sins are deadly. 18 We are sure God's children do not keep on sinning. God's own Son protects them, and the devil cannot harm them. 19 We are certain we come from God and the rest of the world is under the power of the devil. 20 We know that Jesus Christ the Son of God has come and has shown us the true God. And because of Jesus, we now belong to the true God who gives eternal life. 21 Children, you must stay away from idols. "
Common English Bible,CEB,1 John,1,Announcement about the word of life,"We announce to you what existed from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have seen and our hands handled, about the word of life. 2 The life was revealed, and we have seen, and we testify and announce to you the eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us. 3 What we have seen and heard, we also announce it to you so that you can have fellowship with us. Our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. 4 We are writing these things so that our joy can be complete. 5 This is the message that we have heard from him and announce to you: God is light and there is no darkness in him at all. 6 If we claim, We have fellowship with him, and live in the darkness, we are lying and do not act truthfully. 7 But if we live in the light in the same way as he is in the light, we have fellowship with each other, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from every sin. 8 If we claim, We dont have any sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. 9 But if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from everything weve done wrong. 10 If we claim, We have never sinned, we make him a liar and his word is not in us. "
Darby Translation,DARBY,1 John,1,,"That which was from [the] beginning, that which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes; that which we contemplated, and our hands handled, concerning the word of life; 2 (and the life has been manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father, and has been manifested to us:) 3 that which we have seen and heard we report to you, that *ye* also may have fellowship with us; and our fellowship [is] indeed with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. 4 And these things write we to you that your joy may be full. 5 And this is the message which we have heard from him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. 6 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not practise the truth. 7 But if we walk in the light as *he* is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin. 8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us [our] sins, and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. "
Contemporary English Version,CEV,1 John,1,God Is Light,"The Word that gives life was from the beginning, and this is the one our message is about. Our ears have heard, our eyes have seen, and our hands have touched this Word. 2 The one who gives life appeared! We saw it happen, and we are witnesses to what we have seen. Now we are telling you about this eternal life that was with the Father and appeared to us. 3 We are telling you what we have seen and heard, so you may share in this life with us. And we share in it with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. 4 We are writing to tell you these things, because this makes us[a] truly happy. 5 Jesus told us God is light and doesn't have any darkness in him. Now we are telling you. 6 If we say we share in life with God and keep on living in the dark, we are lying and are not living by the truth. 7 But if we live in the light, as God does, we share in life with each other. And the blood of his Son Jesus washes all our sins away. 8 If we say we have not sinned, we are fooling ourselves, and the truth isn't in our hearts. 9 But if we confess our sins to God, he can always be trusted to forgive us and take our sins away. 10 If we say we have not sinned, we make God a liar, and his message isn't in our hearts.[b] "
Contemporary English Version,CEV,1 John,4,God Is Love,"Dear friends, don't believe everyone who claims to have the Spirit of God. Test them all to find out if they really do come from God. Many false prophets have already gone out into the world, 2 and you can know which ones come from God. His Spirit says that Jesus Christ had a truly human body. 3 But when someone doesn't say this about Jesus, you know this person has a spirit that doesn't come from God and is the enemy of Christ. You knew this enemy was coming into the world and now is already here. 4 Children, you belong to God, and you have defeated these enemies. God's Spirit[a] is in you and is more powerful than the one who is in the world. 5 These enemies belong to this world, and the world listens to them, because they speak its language. 6 We belong to God, and everyone who knows God will listen to us. But the people who don't know God won't listen to us. This is how we can tell the Spirit that speaks the truth from the one that tells lies. 7 My dear friends, we must love each other. Love comes from God, and when we love each other, it shows we have been given new life. We are now God's children, and we know him. 8 God is love, and anyone who doesn't love others has never known him. 9 God showed his love for us when he sent his only Son into the world to give us life. 10 Real love isn't our love for God, but his love for us. God sent his Son to be the sacrifice by which our sins are forgiven. 11 Dear friends, since God loved us this much, we must love each other. 12 No one has ever seen God. But if we love each other, God lives in us, and his love is truly in our hearts. 13 God has given us his Spirit. This is how we know we are one with him, just as he is one with us. 14 God sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. We saw his Son and are now telling others about him. 15 God stays one with everyone who openly says Jesus is the Son of God. This is how we stay one with God 16 and are sure God loves us. God is love. If we keep on loving others, we will stay one in our hearts with God, and he will stay one with us. 17 If we truly love others and live as Christ did in this world, we won't be worried about the day of judgment. 18 A real love for others will chase those worries away. The thought of being punished is what makes us afraid. It shows we have not really learned to love. 19 We love because God loved us first. 20 But if we say we love God and don't love each other, we are liars. We cannot see God. So how can we love God, if we don't love the people we can see? 21 The commandment that God has given us is: Love God and love each other! "
Darby Translation,DARBY,1 John,2,,"My children, these things I write to you in order that ye may not sin; and if any one sin, we have a patron with the Father, Jesus Christ [the] righteous; 2 and *he* is the propitiation for our sins; but not for ours alone, but also for the whole world. 3 And hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. 4 He that says, I know him, and does not keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him; 5 but whoever keeps his word, in him verily the love of God is perfected. Hereby we know that we are in him. 6 He that says he abides in him ought, even as *he* walked, himself also [so] to walk. 7 Beloved, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment, which ye have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye heard. 8 Again, I write a new commandment to you, which thing is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing and the true light already shines. 9 He who says he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in the darkness until now. 10 He that loves his brother abides in light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him. 11 But he that hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness, and knows not where he goes, because the darkness has blinded his eyes. 12 I write to you, children, because [your] sins are forgiven you for his name's sake. 13 I write to you, fathers, because ye have known him [that is] from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked [one]. I write to you, little children, because ye have known the Father. 14 I have written to you, fathers, because ye have known him [that is] from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and ye have overcome the wicked [one]. 15 Love not the world, nor the things in the world. If any one love the world, the love of the Father is not in him; 16 because all that [is] in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. 17 And the world is passing, and its lust, but he that does the will of God abides for eternity. 18 Little children, it is [the] last hour, and, according as ye have heard that antichrist comes, even now there have come many antichrists, whence we know that it is [the] last hour. 19 They went out from among us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have surely remained with us, but that they might be made manifest that none are of us. 20 And *ye* have [the] unction from the holy [one], and ye know all things. 21 I have not written to you because ye do not know the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth. 22 Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? *He* is the antichrist who denies the Father and the Son. 23 Whoever denies the Son has not the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also. 24 As for *you* let that which ye have heard from the beginning abide in you: if what ye have heard from the beginning abides in you, *ye* also shall abide in the Son and in the Father. 25 And this is the promise which *he* has promised us, life eternal. 26 These things have I written to you concerning those who lead you astray: 27 and *yourselves*, the unction which ye have received from him abides in you, and ye have not need that any one should teach you; but as the same unction teaches you as to all things, and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, ye shall abide in him. 28 And now, children, abide in him, that if he be manifested we may have boldness, and not be put to shame from before him at his coming. 29 If ye know that he is righteous, know that every one who practises righteousness is begotten of him. "
Common English Bible,CEB,1 John,5,Testimony about Jesus,"Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born from God. Whoever loves someone who is a parent loves the child born to the parent. 2 This is how we know that we love the children of God: when we love God and keep Gods commandments. 3 This is the love of God: we keep Gods commandments. Gods commandments are not difficult, 4 because everyone who is born from God defeats the world. And this is the victory that has defeated the world: our faith. 5 Who defeats the world? Isnt it the one who believes that Jesus is Gods Son? 6 This is the one who came by water and blood: Jesus Christ. Not by water only but by water and blood. And the Spirit is the one who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. 7 The three are testifying 8 the Spirit, the water, and the bloodand the three are united in agreement. 9 If we receive human testimony, Gods testimony is greater, because this is what God testified: he has testified about his Son. 10 The one who believes in Gods Son has the testimony within; the one who doesnt believe God has made God a liar, because that one has not believed the testimony that God gave about his Son. 11 And this is the testimony: God gave eternal life to us, and this life is in his Son. 12 The one who has the Son has life. The one who doesnt have Gods Son does not have life. 13 I write these things to you who believe in the name of Gods Son so that you can know that you have eternal life. 14 This is the confidence that we have in our relationship with God: If we ask for anything in agreement with his will, he listens to us. 15 If we know that he listens to whatever we ask, we know that we have received what we asked from him. 16 If anyone sees a brother or sister committing a sin that does not result in death, they should pray, and God will give life to themthat is, to those who commit sins that dont result in death. There is a sin that results in deathIm not saying that you should pray about that. 17 Every unrighteous action is sin, but there is a sin that does not result in death. 18 We know that everyone born from God does not sin, but the ones born from God guard themselves,[a] and the evil one cannot touch them. 19 We know we are from God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one. 20 We know that Gods Son has come and has given us understanding to know the one who is true. We are in the one who is true by being in his Son, Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. 21 Little children, guard yourselves from idols! "
Disciples Literal New Testament,DLNT,1 John,3,"Abiding Means Loving In Deed And Truth, As Jesus Commanded Us","1 See what-kind-of love the Father has given to us: that we should be called children of God! And we are! For this reason the world does not know us, because it did not know Him. 2 Beloved, we are now children of God, and what we will be has not yet appeared[a]. We know that if He appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is. 3 And everyone having this hope in[b] Him is purifying himself, just as that One is pure. 4 Everyone doing sin also is doing lawlessness. Indeed sin is lawlessness. 5 And you know that that One appeared in order that He might take-away sins. And there is no sin in Him. 6 Everyone abiding in Him is not sinning[c]. Everyone sinning has not seen Him nor known Him. 7 Little-children, let no one be deceiving you the one doing righteousness is righteous, just as that One is righteous. 8 The one doing sin is of the devil, because the devil is sinning[d] from the beginning. The Son of God appeared for this: that He might destroy the works of the devil. 9 Everyone having been born[e] from God is not doing sin because His seed[f] is abiding in him, and he is not able to be sinning[g] because he has been born from God. 10 By this, the children of God and the children of the devil are evident. Everyone not doing[h] righteousness is not from God and the one not loving his brother! 11 Because this is the message which you heard from the beginning: that we should be loving one another. 12 Not as Cain. He was of the evil one, and slew his brother. And for what reason did he slay him? Because his works were evil, but the ones of his brother were righteous. 13 And do not be marveling, brothers, if the world hates you! 14 We know that we have passed from death into life because we are loving the brothers. The one not loving is abiding[i] in death. 15 Everyone hating his brother is a murderer, and you know that every murderer does not have eternal life abiding in him. 16 By this we have come-to-know love: because that One laid-down His life for us. And we ought to lay-down our lives for the brothers. 17 But whoever has the goods of the world and sees his brother having a need and shuts his deep-feelings from him, how is the love of God abiding in him? 18 Little children, let us not be loving with word nor tongue, but in deed and truth. 19 And by this, we will know that we are of[j] the truth, and we will persuade[k] our heart before Him. 20 Because[l] if our heart is condemning[m] us, we know that God is greater[n] than our hearts, and He knows all things. 21 Beloved, if our heart is not condemning us, we have confidence[o] before God. 22 And whatever we are asking, we are receiving from Him, because we are keeping His commandments and doing the pleasing things in His sight. 23 And this is His commandment: that we believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and that we be loving one another, just as He gave us the commandment. 24 And the one keeping His commandments is abiding in Him, and He in him. And by this we know that He is abiding in us: from the Spirit Whom He gave to us. "
Disciples Literal New Testament,DLNT,1 John,5,"Everyone Born of God Believes Jesus Is His Son, Loves His People, Keeps His Commands","Everyone believing that Jesus is the Christ has been born[a] from God. And everyone loving the One[b] having fathered is loving also the one having been born[c] from Him. 2 By this we know that we are loving[d] the children of God: when we are loving God and doing His commandments. 3 For this is the love of God: that we be keeping His commandments. And His commandments are not burdensome. 4 Because everything having been born from God is being-victorious-over the world. And this is the victory having been-victorious-over the world: our faith! 5 And who is the one being-victorious-over the world if not the one believing[e] that Jesus is the Son of God! 6 This One is the One having come by water and blood[f]: Jesus Christ (not in[g] the water only, but[h] in the water and in the blood). And the Spirit is the One testifying, because[i] the Spirit is the truth. 7 Because[j] the ones testifying are three[k]: 8 the Spirit and the water and the blood. And the three are for the[l] one thing. 9 If we receive the testimony of humans, the testimony of God is greater! Because[m] this is the testimony of God: that[n] He has testified about His Son! 10 The one believing in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. The one not believing God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony which God has testified about His Son. 11 And this is the testimony[o]: that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. 12 The one having the Son has the life. The one not having the Son of God does not have the life. 13 I wrote these[p] things to you, the ones believing in the name of the Son of God, in order that you may know that you have eternal life. 14 And this is the confidence which we have before Him: ... that if we request anything according to His will, He hears us. 15 And if we know that He hears us whatever we request we know that we have the requests which we have requested from Him. 16 If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin not leading to death, he shall request, and He will give him life for the ones sinning a sin not leading to death. There is a sin leading to death[q]. I am not saying that he should pray about that. 17 All unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin not leading to death. 18 We know that everyone having been born[r] from God is not sinning[s]. But the One[t] having been fathered from God is keeping[u] him. And the evil one is not touching[v] him. 19 We know that we are from God, and the whole world lies in[w] the evil one. 20 And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding in order that we might know the true[x] One. And we are in[y] the true One, in His Son Jesus Christ. This One[z] is the true God and eternal life. 21 Little-children, guard yourselves from idols! "
Darby Translation,DARBY,1 John,4,,"Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, if they are of God; because many false prophets are gone out into the world. 2 Hereby ye know the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ come in flesh is of God; 3 and every spirit which does not confess Jesus Christ come in flesh is not of God: and this is that [power] of the antichrist, [of] which ye have heard that it comes, and now it is already in the world. 4 *Ye* are of God, children, and have overcome them, because greater is he that [is] in you than he that [is] in the world. 5 *They* are of the world; for this reason they speak [as] of the world, and the world hears them. 6 *We* are of God; he that knows God hears us; he who is not of God does not hear us. From this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error. 7 Beloved, let us love one another; because love is of God, and every one that loves has been begotten of God, and knows God. 8 He that loves not has not known God; for God is love. 9 Herein as to us has been manifested the love of God, that God has sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. 10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son a propitiation for our sins. 11 Beloved, if God has so loved us, we also ought to love one another. 12 No one has seen God at any time: if we love one another, God abides in us, and his love is perfected in us. 13 Hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us, that he has given to us of his Spirit. 14 And *we* have seen, and testify, that the Father has sent the Son [as] Saviour of the world. 15 Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. 16 And *we* have known and have believed the love which God has to us. God is love, and he that abides in love abides in God, and God in him. 17 Herein has love been perfected with us that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, that even as *he* is, *we* also are in this world. 18 There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear; for fear has torment, and he that fears has not been made perfect in love. 19 *We* love because *he* has first loved us. 20 If any one say, I love God, and hate his brother, he is a liar: for he that loves not his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen? 21 And this commandment have we from him, That he that loves God love also his brother.

Disciples Literal New Testament,DLNT,1 John,4,Test The Spirits. The Spirit From God Confesses Christ,"Beloved, do not be believing every spirit, but be testing the spirits[a] to see if they are from God, because many false-prophets have gone out into the world. 2 By this you know[b] the Spirit[c] of God: every spirit that is confessing Jesus Christ as having come in the flesh is from God. 3 And every spirit that is not confessing Jesus is not from God. And this is the spirit of the Antichrist which, you have heard that it is coming, and now it is already in the world. 4 You are from[d] God, little children, and you have overcome them, because greater is the One in you than the one in the world. 5 They are from[e] the world. For this reason they are speaking from the world, and the world is listening-to them. 6 We are from God. The one knowing God is listening-to us. He who is not from God is not listening-to us. From this, we know the Spirit[f] of truth and the spirit of error[g]. 7 Beloved, let us be loving one another. Because the love[h] is from God! And everyone loving has been born[i] from God, and knows God. 8 The one not loving did not know God, because God is love. 9 By this Gods love was made-known among[j] us: that God has sent-forth His only-born[k] Son into the world in order that we might live through Him. 10 In this is love not that we have loved God, but that He loved us, and sent-forth His Son to be the satisfaction[l] for our sins. 11 Beloved, if God loved us in-this-manner[m], we also ought to be loving one another. 12 No one has ever seen God; if we are loving[n] one another, God is abiding in us, and His love[o] has been perfected[p] in us. 13 By this[q] we know that we are abiding in Him and He in us: because He has given to us of His Spirit. 14 And we have seen, and are testifying that the Father has sent-forth the Son to be Savior of the world. 15 Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God is abiding in him and he in God. 16 And we have come-to-know and have believed the love which God has in us. God is love; and the one abiding in the love is abiding in God, and God is abiding in him. 17 By this[r], the love has been perfected with[s] us in order that we may have confidence on the day of judgment. Because just as that One is[t], we also are, in this world. 18 Fear[u] is not in love rather, perfect love throws fear out, because fear has punishment. And the one fearing has not been perfected in love. 19 We are loving because[v] He first loved us. 20 If someone claims that I love God and is hating his brother, he is a liar. For the one not loving his brother whom he has seen cannot be loving God Whom he has not seen. 21 And we have this commandment from Him: that the one loving God should be loving his brother also. "
Disciples Literal New Testament,DLNT,1 John,2,Jesus Is Our Advocate With God. We Know That We Know Him If We Keep His Commands,"My little-children, I am writing these things to you in order that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an advocate[a] with the Father: Jesus Christ the Righteous. 2 And He Himself is the satisfaction[b] for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the whole worlds. 3 And by this we know that we have come-to-know Him: if we are keeping His commandments. 4 The one claiming that I have come-to-know Him and not keeping His commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in this one. 5 But whoever is keeping His word, truly the love of God has been perfected[c] in this one. By this we know that we are in Him: 6 the one claiming to be abiding in Him ought just as that One walked also himself thus to be walking. 7 Beloved, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old[d] commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you heard. 8 Yet-again I am writing a new[e] commandment to you, which[f] is true[g] in Him and in you, because[h] the darkness is passing-away and the true Light[i] is already shining. 9 The one claiming to be in the light and hating his brother is in the darkness until now. 10 The one loving his brother is abiding in the light, and there is no cause-of-falling in him. 11 But the one hating his brother is in the darkness, and is walking in the darkness, and does not know where he is going because the darkness blinded his eyes. 12 I am writing to you, little-children[j], because your sins have been forgiven you for-the-sake-of His name. 13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you have known the One from the beginning. I am writing to you, young-men, because you have overcome the evil one. 14 I wrote[k] to you, children, because you have known the Father. I wrote to you, fathers, because you have known the One from the beginning. I wrote to you, young-men, because you are strong ones, and the word of God is abiding in you, and you have overcome the evil one. 15 Do not be loving the world, nor the things in the world. If anyone is loving the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 Because everything in the world the desire of[l] the flesh, and the desire of the eyes, and the boastful-pride of life[m] is not from the Father, but is from the world. 17 And the world is passing-away, and its desire. But the one doing the will of God abides forever. 18 Children, it is the last[n] hour. And just as you heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have arisen from which we know that it is the last hour. 19 They went out from us, but they were not of[o] us. For if they had been of us, they would have remained with us. But they went out in order that they might be made-evident that[p] they all are not of us. 20 And you have an Anointing[q] from the Holy One, and you all have-knowledge[r]. 21 I did not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and that[s] every lie is not from[t] the truth. 22 Who is the liar if not the one denying that Jesus is the Christ? This one is the antichrist, the one denying the Father and the Son. 23 Everyone denying the Son does also-not have the Father. The one confessing[u] the Son also has the Father. 24 Let what you heard from the beginning be abiding in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will abide in the Son and in the Father. 25 And this is the promise which He Himself promised to us: eternal life. 26 I wrote these things to you concerning the ones deceiving you. 27 And the Anointing which you received from Him is abiding in you. And you have no need that anyone should be teaching[v] you; but as His Anointing is teaching you about all things, and is true and is not a lie, and just as it[w] taught you, be abiding[x] in it[y]. 28 And now little-children, be abiding[z] in Him so that if He appears, we may have confidence and not be put-to-shame[aa] by Him at His coming. 29 If you know[ab] that He[ac] is righteous, you know that everyone also doing righteousness has been born[ad] from Him. "
Disciples Literal New Testament,DLNT,1 John,1,We Are Announcing To You What We Have Personally Witnessed Concerning The Word of Life,"That-which[a] was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we looked-at and our hands touched, concerning the word[b] of life 2 indeed[c] life[d] was made-known! And we have seen and are testifying and are announcing to you the eternal life[e] which was with the Father and was made-known to us! 3 That-which[f] we have seen and heard we are announcing also to you so that you also may have fellowship[g] with us. And indeed our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ. 4 And we are writing these things in order that our joy may be full. 5 And this is the message which we have heard from Him and are declaring to you: that God is light, and there is not any darkness in Him. 6 If we claim that we have fellowship with Him and are walking in the darkness, we are lying and not doing the truth. 7 But if we are walking in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin. 8 If we claim that we do not have[h] sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us. 9 If we are confessing[i] our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us the sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 10 If we claim that we have not sinned, we are making Him a liar and His word is not in us. "
Darby Translation,DARBY,1 John,5,,"Every one that believes that Jesus is the Christ is begotten of God; and every one that loves him that has begotten loves also him that is begotten of him. 2 Hereby know we that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep his commandments. 3 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments; and his commandments are not grievous. 4 For all that has been begotten of God gets the victory over the world; and this is the victory which has gotten the victory over the world, our faith. 5 Who is he that gets the victory over the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God? 6 This is he that came by water and blood, Jesus [the] Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that bears witness, for the Spirit is the truth. 7 For they that bear witness are three: 8 the Spirit, and the water, and the blood; and the three agree in one. 9 If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater. For this is the witness of God [which] he has witnessed concerning his Son. 10 He that believes on the Son of God has the witness in himself; he that does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the witness which God has witnessed concerning his Son. 11 And this is the witness, that God has given to us eternal life; and this life is in his Son. 12 He that has the Son has life: he that has not the Son of God has not life. 13 These things have I written to you that ye may know that ye have eternal life who believe on the name of the Son of God. 14 And this is the boldness which we have towards him, that if we ask him anything according to his will he hears us. 15 And if we know that he hears us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him. 16 If any one see his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life, for those that do not sin unto death. There is a sin to death: I do not say of that that he should make a request. 17 Every unrighteousness is sin; and there is a sin not to death. 18 We know that every one begotten of God does not sin, but he that has been begotten of God keeps himself, and the wicked [one] does not touch him. 19 We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the wicked [one]. 20 And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding that we should know him that [is] true; and we are in him that [is] true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life. 21 Children, keep yourselves from idols. "
Douay-Rheims 1899 American Edition,DRA,1 John,5,,"Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God. And every one that loveth him who begot, loveth him also who is born of him. 2 In this we know that we love the children of God: when we love God, and keep his commandments. 3 For this is the charity of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not heavy. 4 For whatsoever is born of God, overcometh the world: and this is the victory which overcometh the world, our faith. 5 Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? 6 This is he that came by water and blood, Jesus Christ: not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit which testifieth, that Christ is the truth. 7 And there are three who give testimony in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost. And these three are one. 8 And there are three that give testimony on earth: the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three are one. 9 If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater. For this is the testimony of God, which is greater, because he hath testified of his Son. 10 He that believeth in the Son of God, hath the testimony of God in himself. He that believeth not the Son, maketh him a liar: because he believeth not in the testimony which God hath testified of his Son. 11 And this is the testimony, that God hath given to us eternal life. And this life is in his Son. 12 He that hath the Son, hath life. He that hath not the Son, hath not life. 13 These things I write to you, that you may know that you have eternal life, you who believe in the name of the Son of God. 14 And this is the confidence which we have towards him: That, whatsoever we shall ask according to his will, he heareth us. 15 And we know that he heareth us whatsoever we ask: we know that we have the petitions which we request of him. 16 He that knoweth his brother to sin a sin which is not to death, let him ask, and life shall be given to him, who sinneth not to death. There is a sin unto death: for that I say not that any man ask. 17 All iniquity is sin. And there is a sin unto death. 18 We know that whosoever is born of God, sinneth not: but the generation of God preserveth him, and the wicked one toucheth him not. 19 We know that we are of God, and the whole world is seated in wickedness. 20 And we know that the Son of God is come: and he hath given us understanding that we may know the true God, and may be in his true Son. This is the true God and life eternal. 21 Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen. "
Easy-to-Read Version,ERV,1 John,3,We Are Gods Children,"The Father has loved us so much! This shows how much he loved us: We are called children of God. And we really are his children. But the people in the world dont understand that we are Gods children, because they have not known him. 2 Dear friends, now we are children of God. We have not yet been shown what we will be in the future. But we know that when Christ comes again, we will be like him. We will see him just as he is. 3 He is pure, and everyone who has this hope in him keeps themselves pure like Christ. 4 Anyone who sins breaks Gods law. Yes, sinning is the same as living against Gods law. 5 You know that Christ came to take away peoples sins. There is no sin in Christ. 6 So whoever lives in Christ does not continue to sin. If they continue to sin, they have never really understood Christ and have never known him. 7 Dear children, dont let anyone lead you into the wrong way. Christ always did what was right. So to be good like Christ, you must do what is right. 8 The devil has been sinning since the beginning. Anyone who continues to sin belongs to the devil. The Son of God came for this: to destroy the devils work. 9 Those who are Gods children do not continue to sin, because the new life God gave them[a] stays in them. They cannot keep sinning, because they have become children of God. 10 So we can see who Gods children are and who the devils children are. These are the ones who are not Gods children: those who dont do what is right and those who do not love their brothers and sisters in Gods family. 11 This is the teaching you have heard from the beginning: We must love each other. 12 Dont be like Cain. He belonged to the Evil One. Cain killed his brother. But why did he kill him? Because what Cain did was evil, and what his brother did was good. 13 Brothers and sisters, dont be surprised when the people of this world hate you. 14 We know that we have left death and have come into life. We know this because we love each other as brothers and sisters. Anyone who does not love is still in death. 15 Anyone who hates a fellow believer is a murderer.[b] And you know that no murderer has eternal life. 16 This is how we know what real love is: Jesus gave his life for us. So we should give our lives for each other as brothers and sisters. 17 Suppose a believer who is rich enough to have all the necessities of life sees a fellow believer who is poor and does not have even basic needs. What if the rich believer does not help the poor one? Then it is clear that Gods love is not in that persons heart. 18 My children, our love should not be only words and talk. No, our love must be real. We must show our love by the things we do. 19-20 Thats how we know we belong to the way of truth. And when our hearts make us feel guilty, we can still have peace before God, because God is greater than our hearts. He knows everything. 21 My dear friends, if we dont feel that we are doing wrong, we can be without fear when we come to God. 22 And God gives us what we ask for. We receive it because we obey Gods commands and do what pleases him. 23 This is what God commands: that we believe in his Son Jesus Christ, and that we love each other as he commanded. 24 All who obey Gods commands live in God. And God lives in them. How do we know that God lives in us? We know because of the Spirit he gave us. "
Douay-Rheims 1899 American Edition,DRA,1 John,3,,"Behold what manner of charity the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called, and should be the sons of God. Therefore the world knoweth not us, because it knew not him. 2 Dearly beloved, we are now the sons of God; and it hath not yet appeared what we shall be. We know, that, when he shall appear, we shall be like to him: because we shall see him as he is. 3 And every one that hath this hope in him, sanctifieth himself, as he also is holy. 4 Whosoever committeth sin committeth also iniquity; and sin is iniquity. 5 And you know that he appeared to take away our sins, and in him there is no sin. 6 Whosoever abideth in him, sinneth not; and whosoever sinneth, hath not seen him, nor known him. 7 Little children, let no man deceive you. He that doth justice is just, even as he is just. 8 He that committeth sin is of the devil: for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose, the Son of God appeared, that he might destroy the works of the devil. 9 Whosoever is born of God, committeth not sin: for his seed abideth in him, and he can not sin, because he is born of God. 10 In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil. Whosoever is not just, is not of God, nor he that loveth not his brother. 11 For this is the declaration, which you have heard from the beginning, that you should love one another. 12 Not as Cain, who was of the wicked one, and killed his brother. And wherefore did he kill him? Because his own works were wicked: and his brother's just. 13 Wonder not, brethren, if the world hate you. 14 We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not, abideth in death. 15 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer. And you know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in himself. 16 In this we have known the charity of God, because he hath laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. 17 He that hath the substance of this world, and shall see his brother in need, and shall shut up his bowels from him: how doth the charity of God abide in him? 18 My little children, let us not love in word, nor in tongue, but in deed, and in truth. 19 In this we know that we are of the truth: and in his sight shall persuade our hearts. 20 For if our heart reprehend us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. 21 Dearly beloved, if our heart do not reprehend us, we have confidence towards God: 22 And whatsoever we shall ask, we shall receive of him: because we keep his commandments, and do those things which are pleasing in his sight. 23 And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ: and love one another, as he hath given commandment unto us. 24 And he that keepeth his commandments, abideth in him, and he in him. And in this we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us. "
EasyEnglish Bible,EASY,1 John,1,Jesus is God's message to people,"We have an important message to tell you. We want to tell you about the person who was already there before the beginning of the world. We have heard him speak. We have seen him with our own eyes. We watched him and we touched him. He is the Word that gives us life with God.[a] 2 He showed himself clearly when he lived on this earth. From long ago he was together with God the Father, and he lives for ever. We saw him and we are telling you what is true. He is the one who has shown himself to us. 3 We also want you to share this new life with us. We share this life with God the Father and Jesus Christ his Son. That is why we are telling you about everything that we have seen and heard. 4 We are writing to you so that together we all may be completely happy. 5 We are telling you the good news that Jesus Christ told to us. This is the message: God is completely good and clean. He is like light. There is nothing dark about him. 6 Do you say that you share in the life that God gives? If you say that, but if you still live in the dark, you are telling a lie. You are not living in God's true way. 7 But when we live in a right way, it is like living in the light. God is always in the light. So, if we live in the light, we share together in the life which God gives. And when Jesus, the Son of God, died on the cross, he saved us from all our sins. The blood of his sacrifice makes us clean. 8 If we say that we never do any wrong thing, we are deceiving ourselves. Even though we may think it is true, it is a lie. 9 Instead, we should agree that we have done wrong things and tell that to God. Then God will forgive us for our sins. He always does what he has promised to do. He always does what is right. He will forgive us and he will make us clean again, whatever bad things we may have done. 10 God says that all people have done wrong things. So, if we say that we have not done any wrong thing, we are saying that God tells lies. It shows that we have not accepted his message at all. "
Easy-to-Read Version,ERV,1 John,2,Jesus Is Our Helper,"My dear children, I write this letter to you so that you will not sin. But if anyone sins, we have Jesus Christ to help us. He always did what was right, so he is able to defend us before God the Father. 2 Jesus is the way our sins are taken away. And he is the way all people can have their sins taken away too. 3 If we obey what God has told us to do, then we are sure that we know him. 4 If we say we know God but do not obey his commands, we are lying. The truth is not in us. 5 But when we obey Gods teaching, his love is truly working in us. This is how we know that we are living in him. 6 If we say we live in God, we must live the way Jesus lived. 7 My dear friends, I am not writing a new command to you. It is the same command you have had since the beginning. This command is the teaching you have already heard. 8 But what I write is also a new command. It is a true one; you can see its truth in Jesus and in yourselves. The darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining. 9 Someone might say, I am in the light, but if they hate any of their brothers or sisters in Gods family, they are still in the darkness. 10 Those who love their brothers and sisters live in the light, and there is nothing in them that will make them do wrong. 11 But whoever hates their brother or sister is in darkness. They live in darkness. They dont know where they are going, because the darkness has made them blind. 12 I write to you, dear children, because your sins are forgiven through Christ. 13 I write to you, fathers, because you know the one who existed from the beginning. I write to you, young people, because you have defeated the Evil One. 14 I write to you, children, because you know the Father. I write to you, fathers, because you know the one who existed from the beginning. I write to you, young people, because you are strong. The word of God lives in you, and you have defeated the Evil One. 15 Dont love this evil world or the things in it. If you love the world, you do not have the love of the Father in you. 16 This is all there is in the world: wanting to please our sinful selves, wanting the sinful things we see, and being too proud of what we have. But none of these comes from the Father. They come from the world. 17 The world is passing away, and all the things that people want in the world are passing away. But whoever does what God wants will live forever. 18 My dear children, the end is near! You have heard that the enemy of Christ is coming. And now many enemies of Christ are already here. So we know that the end is near. 19 These enemies were in our group, but they left us. They did not really belong with us. If they were really part of our group, they would have stayed with us. But they left. This shows that none of them really belonged with us. 20 You have the gift[a] that the Holy One[b] gave you. So you all know the truth. 21 Do you think I am writing this letter because you dont know the truth? No, I am writing because you do know the truth. And you know that no lie comes from the truth. 22 So who is the liar? It is the one who says Jesus is not the Messiah. Whoever says that is the enemy of Christthe one who does not believe in the Father or in his Son. 23 Whoever does not believe in the Son does not have the Father, but whoever accepts the Son has the Father too. 24 Be sure that you continue to follow the teaching you heard from the beginning. If you do that, you will always be in the Son and in the Father. 25 And this is what the Son promised useternal life. 26 I am writing this letter about those who are trying to lead you into the wrong way. 27 Christ gave you a special gift. You still have this gift in you. So you dont need anyone to teach you. The gift he gave you teaches you about everything. It is a true gift, not a false one. So continue to live in Christ, as his gift taught you. 28 Yes, my dear children, live in him. If we do this, we can be without fear on the day when Christ comes again. We will not need to hide and be ashamed when he comes. 29 You know that Christ always did what was right. So you know that all those who do what is right are Gods children. "
Easy-to-Read Version,ERV,1 John,4,John Warns Against False Teachers,"My dear friends, many false prophets are in the world now. So dont believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see if they are from God. 2 This is how you can recognize Gods Spirit. One spirit says, I believe that Jesus is the Messiah who came to earth and became a man. That Spirit is from God. 3 Another spirit refuses to say this about Jesus. That spirit is not from God. This is the spirit of the enemy of Christ. You have heard that the enemy of Christ is coming, and now he is already in the world. 4 My dear children, you belong to God, so you have already defeated these false prophets. Thats because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. 5 And they belong to the world, so what they say is from the world too. And the world listens to what they say. 6 But we are from God. So the people who know God listen to us. But the people who are not from God dont listen to us. This is how we know the Spirit that is true and the spirit that is false. 7 Dear friends, we should love each other, because love comes from God. Everyone who loves has become Gods child. And so everyone who loves knows God. 8 Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love. 9 This is how God showed his love to us: He sent his only Son into the world to give us life through him. 10 True love is Gods love for us, not our love for God. He sent his Son as the way to take away our sins. 11 That is how much God loved us, dear friends! So we also must love each other. 12 No one has ever seen God. But if we love each other, God lives in us. If we love each other, Gods love has reached its goalit is made perfect in us. 13 We know that we live in God and God lives in us. We know this because he gave us his Spirit. 14 We have seen that the Father sent his Son to be the Savior of the world, and this is what we tell people now. 15 Anyone who says, I believe that Jesus is the Son of God, is a person who lives in God, and God lives in that person. 16 So we know the love that God has for us, and we trust that love. God is love. Everyone who lives in love lives in God, and God lives in them. 17 If Gods love is made perfect in us, we can be without fear on the day when God judges the world. We will be without fear, because in this world we are like Jesus.[a] 18 Where Gods love is, there is no fear, because Gods perfect love takes away fear. It is his punishment that makes a person fear. So his love is not made perfect in the one who has fear. 19 We love because God first loved us. 20 If we say we love God but hate any of our brothers or sisters in his family, we are liars. If we dont love someone we have seen, how can we love God? We have never even seen him. 21 God gave us this command: If we love God, we must also love each other as brothers and sisters. "
Douay-Rheims 1899 American Edition,DRA,1 John,4,,"Dearly beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits if they be of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. 2 By this is the spirit of God known. Every spirit which confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God: 3 And every spirit that dissolveth Jesus, is not of God: and this is Antichrist, of whom you have heard that he cometh, and he is now already in the world. 4 You are of God, little children, and have overcome him. Because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. 5 They are of the world: therefore of the world they speak, and the world heareth them. 6 We are of God. He that knoweth God, heareth us. He that is not of God, heareth us not. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error. 7 Dearly beloved, let us love one another, for charity is of God. And every one that loveth, is born of God, and knoweth God. 8 He that loveth not, knoweth not God: for God is charity. 9 By this hath the charity of God appeared towards us, because God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we may live by him. 10 In this is charity: not as though we had loved God, but because he hath first loved us, and sent his Son to be a propitiation for our sins. 11 My dearest, if God hath so loved us; we also ought to love one another. 12 No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abideth in us, and his charity is perfected in us. 13 In this we know that we abide in him, and he in us: because he hath given us of his spirit. 14 And we have seen, and do testify, that the Father hath sent his Son to be the Saviour of the world. 15 Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he in God. 16 And we have known, and have believed the charity, which God hath to us. God is charity: and he that abideth in charity, abideth in God, and God in him. 17 In this is the charity of God perfected with us, that we may have confidence in the day of judgment: because as he is, we also are in this world. 18 Fear is not in charity: but perfect charity casteth out fear, because fear hath pain. And he that feareth, is not perfected in charity. 19 Let us therefore love God, because God first hath loved us. 20 If any man say, I love God, and hateth his brother; he is a liar. For he that loveth not his brother, whom he seeth, how can he love God, whom he seeth not? 21 And this commandment we have from God, that he, who loveth God, love also his brother. "
Easy-to-Read Version,ERV,1 John,5,Gods Children Win Against the World,"The people who believe that Jesus is the Messiah are Gods children. Anyone who loves the Father also loves the Fathers children. 2 How do we know that we love Gods children? We know because we love God and we obey his commands. 3 Loving God means obeying his commands. And Gods commands are not too hard for us, 4 because everyone who is a child of God has the power to win against the world. 5 It is our faith that has won the victory against the world. So who wins against the world? Only those who believe that Jesus is the Son of God. 6 Jesus Christ is the one who came. He came with water and with blood.[a] He did not come by water only. No, Jesus came by both water and blood. And the Spirit tells us that this is true. The Spirit is the truth. 7 So there are three witnesses that tell us about Jesus: 8 the Spirit, the water, and the blood. These three witnesses agree. 9 We believe people when they say something is true. But what God says is more important. And this is what God told us: He told us the truth about his own Son. 10 Whoever believes in the Son of God has the truth that God told us. But people who do not believe God make God a liar, because they do not believe what God told us about his Son. 11 This is what God told us: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12 Whoever has the Son has life, but whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life. 13 I write this letter to you who believe in the Son of God. I write so that you will know that you have eternal life now. 14 We can come to God with no doubts. This means that when we ask God for things (and those things agree with what God wants for us), God cares about what we say. 15 He listens to us every time we ask him. So we know that he gives us whatever we ask from him. 16 Suppose you see your fellow believer sinning (sin that does not lead to eternal death). You should pray for them. Then God will give them life. I am talking about people whose sin does not lead to eternal death. There is sin that leads to death. I dont mean that you should pray about that kind of sin. 17 Doing wrong is always sin. But there is sin that does not lead to eternal death. 18 We know that those who have been made Gods children do not continue to sin. The Son of God keeps them safe.[b] The Evil One cannot hurt them. 19 We know that we belong to God, but the Evil One controls the whole world. 20 And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding. So now we can know the one who is true, and we live in that true God. We are in his Son, Jesus Christ. He is the true God, and he is eternal life. 21 So, dear children, keep yourselves away from false gods. "
Douay-Rheims 1899 American Edition,DRA,1 John,1,,"That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the word of life: 2 For the life was manifested; and we have seen and do bear witness, and declare unto you the life eternal, which was with the Father, and hath appeared to us: 3 That which we have seen and have heard, we declare unto you, that you also may have fellowship with us, and our fellowship may be with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. 4 And these things we write to you, that you may rejoice, and your joy may be full. 5 And this is the declaration which we have heard from him, and declare unto you: That God is light, and in him there is no darkness. 6 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth. 7 But if we walk in the light, as he also is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. 8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just, to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all iniquity. 10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.

Easy-to-Read Version,ERV,1 John,1,God Forgives Our Sins,"We want to tell you about the Word[a] that gives lifethe one who existed before the world began. This is the one we have heard and have seen with our own eyes. We saw what he did, and our hands touched him. 2 Yes, the one who is life was shown to us. We saw him, and so we can tell others about him. We now tell you about him. He is the eternal life that was with God the Father and was shown to us. 3 We are telling you about what we have seen and heard because we want you to have fellowship[b] with us. The fellowship we share together is with God the Father and his Son Jesus Christ. 4 We write these things to you so that you can be full of joy with us. 5 We heard the true teaching from God. Now we tell it to you: God is light, and in him there is no darkness. 6 So if we say that we share in life with God, but we continue living in darkness, we are liars, who dont follow the truth. 7 We should live in the light, where God is. If we live in the light, we have fellowship with each other, and the blood sacrifice of Jesus, Gods Son, washes away every sin and makes us clean. 8 If we say that we have no sin, we are fooling ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 9 But if we confess our sins, God will forgive us. We can trust God to do this. He always does what is right. He will make us clean from all the wrong things we have done. 10 If we say that we have not sinned, we are saying that God is a liar and that we dont accept his true teaching. "
Douay-Rheims 1899 American Edition,DRA,1 John,2,,"My little children, these things I write to you, that you may not sin. But if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the just: 2 And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world. 3 And by this we know that we have known him, if we keep his commandments. 4 He who saith that he knoweth him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 5 But he that keepeth his word, in him in very deed the charity of God is perfected; and by this we know that we are in him. 6 He that saith he abideth in him, ought himself also to walk, even as he walked. 7 Dearly beloved, I write not a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard. 8 Again a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true both in him and in you; because the darkness is passed, and the true light now shineth. 9 He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now. 10 He that loveth his brother, abideth in the light, and there is no scandal in him. 11 But he that hateth his brother, is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth; because the darkness hath blinded his eyes. 12 I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake. 13 I write unto you, fathers, because you have known him, who is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one. 14 I write unto you, babes, because you have known the Father. I write unto you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and you have overcome the wicked one. 15 Love not the world, nor the things which are in the world. If any man love the world, the charity of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in the world, is the concupiscence of the flesh, and the concupiscence of the eyes, and the pride of life, which is not of the Father, but is of the world. 17 And the world passeth away, and the concupiscence thereof: but he that doth the will of God, abideth for ever. 18 Little children, it is the last hour; and as you have heard that Antichrist cometh, even now there are become many Antichrists: whereby we know that it is the last hour. 19 They went out from us, but they were not of us. For if they had been of us, they would no doubt have remained with us; but that they may be manifest, that they are not all of us. 20 But you have the unction from the Holy One, and know all things. 21 I have not written to you as to them that know not the truth, but as to them that know it: and that no lie is of the truth. 22 Who is a liar, but he who denieth that Jesus is the Christ? This is Antichrist, who denieth the Father, and the Son. 23 Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father. He that confesseth the Son, hath the Father also. 24 As for you, let that which you have heard from the beginning, abide in you. If that abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning, you also shall abide in the Son, and in the Father. 25 And this is the promise which he hath promised us, life everlasting. 26 These things have I written to you, concerning them that seduce you. 27 And as for you, let the unction, which you have received from him, abide in you. And you have no need that any man teach you; but as his unction teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie. And as it hath taught you, abide in him. 28 And now, little children, abide in him, that when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be confounded by him at his coming. 29 If you know, that he is just, know ye, that every one also, who doth justice, is born of him.

EasyEnglish Bible,EASY,1 John,4,The Holy Spirit and false spirits,"My friends, do not believe everyone who says that they speak God's message. There are many false prophets who are travelling around everywhere. They say that they have a message from God's Spirit, but the message comes from a false spirit. So check each message carefully to see if it is really from God. 2 How do you know whether a person has God's Spirit in him? He must agree that Jesus is God's Messiah who was born as a human baby. If someone says that, then he has God's Spirit. 3 But if someone does not agree to say that about Jesus, he does not have God's Spirit. That person has a spirit that comes from the enemy of Christ. You have heard that this enemy of Christ would come among us. Now this spirit is already here in the world. 4 My little children, you belong to God. You have won against those people with a false message. You have been able to do that because God's Holy Spirit is in you. He is more powerful than the spirit that belongs to this world. 5 Those false prophets belong to this world. Their message comes from the ideas of people of this world. So the people of this world believe what they teach. 6 But we belong to God. Everyone who knows God believes our message. But anyone who does not belong to God does not believe it. So that is how we know if someone's message comes from God's Spirit or not. God's Spirit brings us a true message, but false spirits tell lies.[a] 7 My friends, we should all love each other. It is God who makes us able to love other people. Everyone who loves other people has become a child of God. That person knows God. 8 Anyone who does not love other people does not know God. We know this because God's own nature is love. 9 This is how God showed that he loves us: He sent his only Son to come and live in the world. He did that so that we could have true life with God because of his Son. 10 This shows what love is: It is not that we have loved God, but that he loved us. He loved us so much that he sent his Son to save us from sin. He sent Jesus to die as a sacrifice, to take the punishment for our sins. 11 My friends, this shows how much God has loved us. So we should also love one another. 12 Nobody has ever seen God. But, if we love each other, it shows that God lives in us. As a result, we can love people completely, in the same way that God loves us. 13 God has given us his Holy Spirit to live in us. Because of this, we know that we live together with God. And we know that he lives with us. 14 God the Father sent his Son to come into the world. God sent him to save the people of the world from their sins. We apostles have seen that this is true. So now we are telling people about it. 15 If anyone says clearly that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in that person. And that person lives together with God. 16 So we know the kind of love that God has for us. We believe that God has put that love in us. God's nature is love. So, if someone continues to love other people, he is living together with God. And God lives in him. 17 That is how we are able to love other people completely. Then, we will not be afraid on the day when God will judge all people. We can be sure that God will not punish us. We know this because we have lived in this world in the way that Jesus lived. 18 If we really love God, we will not be afraid of him. We cannot love him completely and also be afraid. We would only be afraid of God if we thought that he would punish us. So, if someone is afraid that God will punish them, it shows that they do not completely know God's love. 19 We are able to love God and other people because God loved us first. 20 Someone may say, I love God. But if he says that and he hates another Christian, he is telling a lie. He sees other believers but he does not love them. So he surely cannot love God that he has not seen. 21 This is the command that God has given us. He has told us that anyone who loves him should love other Christians too.[b] "
EasyEnglish Bible,EASY,1 John,2,God forgives our sins because of Jesus' death,"I am writing this letter to you, my friends who are like my little children. I am writing to you because I do not want you to do wrong things. But if anyone among you does something wrong, there is someone who will speak to God on our behalf. That person is Jesus Christ, who always does only what is right. He will ask our Father God to forgive you. 2 Jesus died as a sacrifice to take the punishment for our sin. Then God could forgive us. Jesus did that not only for us. He did it for all people in the world, so that God could forgive them for their sins. 3 This is how we can be sure that we know God: If we obey God's commands, we know that we belong to him. 4 Someone may say, I belong to God. But if he does not obey God's commands, that person is telling a lie. He is not living in the way that God's true message teaches us. 5 But anyone who obeys God's message shows that he really loves God completely. So this is how we know that we belong to God. 6 If we say that we are living in God's true way, then we must live in the way that Jesus lived.[a] 7 My friends, I am telling you to love one another. When I write this to you, I am not giving you a new rule. It is an old rule that you have had for a long time. We gave it to you when you began to obey Christ. It is the same message that you have already heard. 8 But there is something new about it. This rule has become true in the way that Christ lived. Now it has also become true in your lives. God's true message has brought light to shine in your lives. You no longer live in the dark where you do bad things. 9 A person may say that he is living in the light. But if that person hates another believer, then he is telling a lie. He is still living in the dark. 10 Anyone who loves other believers shows that he is living in the light. There is nothing that will make him turn away from God. 11 But if someone hates other believers, he is still living in a bad way. He is like someone who is walking in the dark. He cannot see where he is going. He is like a blind person. He cannot understand God's true message.[b] 12 My little children, I am writing to you because God has forgiven your sins. He has done this because of Christ. 13 You who are older, like fathers, I am writing to you because you know Christ. He has always been there, since before the world began. You who are young men, I am writing to you because you have won against Satan. 14 Yes, my children, I have written to you because you know God, our Father. Fathers, I have written to you because you know Christ. He was already there before the world began. Young men, I have written to you because you are strong. You continue to obey God's message, and you have won against Satan. 15 Do not live like people who do not know God. Do not love the wrong things that belong to this world. If anyone loves those things, it shows that they do not love God, their Father. 16 What are the wrong things that belong to this world? People want to do bad things to make themselves happy. People want to have things that they see, even bad things. People want to show other people how rich they are. These ideas do not come from God, our Father. They are the thoughts of people who belong to the world. 17 One day, those people and the things that they want will not be there any longer. But those who continue to do what God wants will live for ever. 18 My children, the world will soon end.[c] You have heard that the enemy of Christ will appear. You can see that many enemies of Christ have already appeared. This shows us that the world will end soon. 19 These people used to be in our group of believers. But they left us. They never really belonged to our group. If they had been true believers, they would have remained with us. When they left us, it showed clearly that none of them really belonged to us. 20 But Christ, the Holy One, has given you the Holy Spirit. As a result, you all know what is true. 21 That is why I am writing to you. It is not because you do not yet know God's true message. I am writing to you because you do know that true message. And you can be sure that there are no lies in it. 22 Who is the one who tells the worst lies? It is anyone who says that Jesus is not the Messiah. A person like that is the enemy of Christ. He is speaking against God, the Father, and against Jesus, his Son. 23 Anyone who says that Jesus is not God's Son does not belong to the Father. But anyone who accepts Jesus as the Son of God also belongs to the Father.[d] 24 As for you, always remember the true message that you heard at the beginning. If you continue to believe that message, you will continue to live with the Son and with the Father. 25 That is the real life that continues for ever. And that is what God has promised to give to us. 26 Some people are trying to lead you away from God's true message. I am writing these things to you so that you know about these people. 27 But Christ has given the Holy Spirit to you, and he continues to help you. So you do not need people to teach you what is true. The Holy Spirit himself teaches you everything about God's message. He helps you to know what is true. He does not tell you any lies. So you must remember what he has taught you. Continue to live together with Christ. 28 Yes, my children, continue to live with Christ. Then we will not be ashamed when he returns to this world. We will not be afraid to meet him. 29 You know that Christ only does what is right. So you should know this: Everyone who continues to do what is right has become a child of God. "
Evangelical Heritage Version,EHV,1 John,2,Do Not Love the World,"My children, I write these things to you so that you will not sin. If anyone does sin, we have an Advocate before the Father: Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. 2 He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the whole world. 3 This is how we know that we have known him: if we keep his commands. 4 The one who says, I know him, but does not keep his commands is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 5 If anyone keeps Gods word, the love of God is truly made complete in him. This is how we know that we are in him: 6 The one who says he remains in him should walk as Jesus[a] walked. 7 Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old one that you have had since the beginning. The old command is the message you heard. 8 At the same time, the command I am writing is newit is true in Jesus[b] and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining. 9 The one who says he is in the light and yet hates his brother is still in the darkness. 10 The one who loves his brother remains in the light, and nothing causes him to stumble. 11 The one who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes. 12 I am writing to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven because of his name. 13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the Evil One. 14 I have written to you, little children, because you have known the Father. I have written to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God remains in you, and you have overcome the Evil One. 15 Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For everything in the worldthe lust of the flesh, the desire of the eyes, boasting about material possessionsis not from the Father but from the world. 17 The world and its desires pass away, but the one who does the will of God remains forever. 18 Dear children, it is the last hour. The Antichrist is coming, just as you have heard, and even now many antichrists have come. (This is how you know that it is the last hour.) 19 They went out from us, but they really were not part of us. If they had been part of us, they would have stayed with us. Instead they all showed that they were not part of us. 20 You have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know all things.[c] 21 I did not write to you because you do not know the truth but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth. 22 Who is a liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is an antichrist: the one who denies the Father and the Son. 23 Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father. But the one who confesses the Son has the Father as well. 24 Let what you have heard from the beginning remain in you. If what you have heard from the beginning remains in you, then you will remain in the Son and the Father. 25 And this is what he promised you: eternal life. 26 I have written these things to you about those who are misleading you. 27 As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you have no need for someone to teach you. Rather, since his anointing teaches you all things and since it is true and is no lie, remain in him, just as it has taught you. 28 So now, dear children, remain in him so that we may be confident when he appears and may be unashamed before him at his coming. 29 If you know that he is righteous, then you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him. "
Evangelical Heritage Version,EHV,1 John,3,Love From the Father,"See the kind of love the Father has given us that we should be called children of God, and that is what we are! The world does not know us, because it did not know him. 2 Dear friends, we are children of God now, but what we will be has not yet been revealed. We know that when he is revealed we will be like him, and we will see him as he really is. 3 Everyone who has this hope purifies himself just as Jesus[a] is pure. 4 Everyone who commits sin also commits lawlessness. Sin is lawlessness. 5 You know that he appeared in order to take away our sins and in him there is no sin. 6 Anyone who remains in him does not sin. The person who keeps on sinning has not seen him or known him. 7 Dear children, do not let anyone deceive you. Whoever does what is right is righteous just as Jesus[b] is righteous. 8 The one who continues to sin is of the Devil, because the Devil has been sinning from the beginning. This is why the Son of God appeared: to destroy the works of the Devil. 9 Nobody who has been born of God continues to commit sin, because Gods seed remains in him. He cannot go on sinning, because he has been born of God. 10 This is how the children of God and the children of the Devil are obvious: Everyone who does not do what is right is not from God, along with everyone who does not love his brother. 11 This is the message you have heard from the beginning: Love one another. 12 Do not be like Cain, who belonged to the Evil One and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own works were evil, while those of his brother were righteous. 13 Do not be surprised, brothers,[c] if the world hates you. 14 We know that we have crossed over from death to life, because we love our brothers. The one who does not love[d] remains in death. 15 Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him. 16 This is how we have come to know love: Jesus[e] laid down his life for us. And we also should lay down our lives for our brothers. 17 Whoever has worldly wealth and sees his brother in need but closes his heart against himhow can Gods love remain in him? 18 Dear children, let us love not only with word or with our tongue, but also in action and truth. 19 This is how we know that we are of the truth and how we will set our hearts at rest in his presence: 20 If our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything. 21 Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God. 22 We also receive from him whatever we ask, because we keep his commands and do what is pleasing in his sight. 23 This then is his command: that we believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and that we love one another just as he commanded us. 24 The one who keeps his commands remains in God[f] and God[g] in him. This is how we know that he remains in us: We know it from the Spirit, whom he has given to us. "
EasyEnglish Bible,EASY,1 John,5,Believe in Jesus Christ,"Everyone who believes that Jesus is God's Messiah has become a child of God. And if we love God, our Father, we will love his other children too. 2 How do we know that we love God's children? We know it when we love God and we do what he tells us to do. 3 Because, if we really love God, we will obey his commands. And those commands are not difficult for us to obey. 4 Because we have become God's children, we can live in a good way. We can refuse to live like people who belong to this world. We are able to win against the wrong ways of this world because we trust Jesus Christ. 5 It is only people who believe that Jesus is the Son of God who can do that. Only they can win against the wrong ways of this world. 6 Jesus Christ is the man that God sent into the world. John baptized Jesus in water. When Jesus died, his blood poured out. God showed that Jesus is his Son with the water and with the blood. It was not only with the water of Jesus' baptism. It was also with the blood of his death. God's Holy Spirit also shows us that Jesus is God's Son. The Holy Spirit always says what is true. 7 So there are three things that show us clearly that Jesus came from God. 8 Those things are the Holy Spirit, the water of Jesus' baptism and the blood of his death on the cross. These all show us the same thing, that Jesus came from God.[a] 9 We believe people who tell us about things that they know. So we can believe even more what God says. He has told us what is true about his Son. So we should believe his message. 10 Anyone who believes in Jesus, the Son of God, will know that what God says is true. But anyone who does not believe God is saying that God tells lies. He does not believe the message that God has told us clearly about his Son. 11 This is what God has told us: God has given us life with him that never ends. We receive this life when we believe in his Son, Jesus. 12 So whoever belongs to the Son has this true life. But anyone who does not belong to the Son of God does not have this true life. 13 I have written these things to you who believe that Jesus is the Son of God. I want you to know that you have true life with God for ever. 14 Also, we can trust God to help us when we turn to him. We know that he will hear us. When we ask for anything that he wants us to have, he listens to us. 15 Since we know that, we also know that God will give to us the things that we ask for. It is like we have already received those things from him. 16 If you see that another Christian is doing something bad, this is what you should do. If it is a sin that does not cause death, pray that God will help him. Then God will help that person to live for ever with him. That is for a sin which does not cause death. But there is a sin that causes death. If another Christian does that, I am not saying that you should pray for God to help that person. 17 Any wrong thing that a person does is sin. But not all sins cause death.[b] 18 Nobody who has become a child of God continues to do wrong things. Instead, the Son of God keeps him safe.[c] Satan cannot do anything against a child of God. 19 We know that we belong to God. We know that Satan rules all the people who belong to this world. 20 We also know that the Son of God has come into the world. He has helped us to understand what is true. As a result, we know the only true God. We live together with this true God, because we belong to his Son, Jesus Christ. He is the true God. He is the one who gives us life with God for ever. 21 My little children, be careful to keep away from idols.[d] "
Evangelical Heritage Version,EHV,1 John,1,The Word of Life,"That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have observed and our hands have touched regarding the Word of Life 2 the life appeared, and we have seen it. We testify and proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and has appeared to us. 3 We are proclaiming what we have seen and heard also to you, so that you may have fellowship with us. Our fellowship is with the Father and his Son Jesus Christ. 4 We write these things to you so that our[a] joy may be complete. 5 This is the message we heard from him and proclaim to you: God is light. In him there is no darkness at all. 6 If we say we have fellowship with him but still walk in darkness, we are lying and do not put the truth into practice. 7 But if we walk in the light, just as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ,[b] his Son, cleanses us from all sin. 8 If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 10 If we say we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar, and his Word[c] is not in us.

EasyEnglish Bible,EASY,1 John,3,We are God's children,"Think about how much God the Father loves us. He calls us his children! God loves us so much that we really have become his children. The people who belong to this world do not understand who God is. Because of that, they do not understand who we are. 2 My friends, we are already children of God. We do not yet know clearly what we will become. But we do know this: when Christ returns to this world, we will become like him. We will be like him because we will see him as he really is. 3 Christ is completely good. So all of us who hope to see him then must keep ourselves clean from sin. 4 If a person continues to do wrong things, he is choosing not to obey God's rules. Sin is when we do not obey God's rules. 5 You know that Jesus came into the world so that he might take away our sins. He himself is completely clean from sin. 6 Anyone who lives together with Christ does not continue to do wrong things. If anyone continues to do wrong things, that person has not understood who Christ is. He does not know Christ. 7 My little children, do not let anyone deceive you about sin. It is people who live in a good way that God accepts as right. In the same way, Jesus did only what is good and right. 8 People who continue to do wrong things show that they belong to the Devil. The Devil has always been doing wrong things from the beginning. This is why the Son of God came to the world. He came to destroy everything that the Devil has done. 9 Everybody who is a child of God does not continue to do wrong things. This is because God has given them a new life. He has caused them to become his children. So they cannot continue to do wrong things. 10 In this way, we can see clearly who are God's children and who are the Devil's children. Anyone who does not live in a way that is good and right does not belong to God. People like that do not love other believers. 11 Yes, we must love one another. That is the message which you have heard from the beginning. 12 We should not be like Cain. He belonged to Satan and he even killed his brother, Abel. Why did he do that? Cain did bad things and he killed Abel because Abel did things that were right. 13 So, my Christian friends, do not be surprised when people who belong to this world hate you. 14 We know that we now have new life with God. Death no longer has power over us. We know this because we love our Christian friends. But anyone who does not love other believers is still under the power of death. 15 Anyone who hates other believers is like someone who murders other people. You know that a person like that does not have true life with God. 16 This is how we know what true love is: Jesus Christ gave his own life on the cross. He died on our behalf. So we too ought to give our lives for other believers. 17 When another believer has trouble, we need to be kind to him. Maybe you have all the things that you need to live. If you see another believer who needs things like that, you should help him. If you refuse to be kind to him, it shows that you do not belong to God. You do not love people in the way that God loves them.[a] 18 My little children, we should not show love for each other only by what we say. We should also show true love by the things that we do. 19 Then we will know that we truly belong to God. We will be obeying God's true message. As a result, our thoughts will not make us ashamed to come to God. 20 Even if our thoughts tell us that we have done something wrong, we still will not be afraid of God. We can trust God more than we trust our thoughts. He already knows everything about us. 21 My friends, if our thoughts do not tell us that we are guilty, we will not be afraid to come to God. 22 We can pray to God and we can ask him to help us. He will give us what we ask him for. That is because we obey his commands and we do the things that please him. 23 This is God's command to us: we must believe that Jesus Christ is his Son. And we must love each other, as Jesus commanded us. 24 Anyone who obeys God's commands lives together with God. God also lives in him. How do we know that God lives in us? It is because of his Holy Spirit that he has given to us. "
English Standard Version,ESV,1 John,3,Love One Another,"See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called (B)children of God; and so we are. The reason why (C)the world does not know us is that (D)it did not know him. 2 Beloved, we are God's children (F)now, and what we will be (G)has not yet appeared; but we know that (H)when he appears[a] (I)we shall be like him, because (J)we shall see him as he is. 3 And everyone who thus hopes in him (L)purifies himself as he is pure. 4 Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness. 5 You know that he appeared in order to (O)take away sins, and (P)in him there is no sin. 6 No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him. 7 Little children, let no one deceive you. (S)Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous. 8 Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was (U)to destroy the works of the devil. 9 No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's[b] seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God. 10 By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who (X)does not love his brother. 11 For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning, (Z)that we should love one another. 12 We should not be like Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? (AB)Because his own deeds were evil and his brother's righteous. 13 Do not be surprised, brothers,[c] that the world hates you. 14 We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. Whoever does not love abides in death. 15 Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that (AF)no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. 16 By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us, and (AH)we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers. 17 But if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet (AJ)closes his heart against him, (AK)how does God's love abide in him? 18 Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and (AM)in truth. 19 By this we shall know that we are of the truth and reassure our heart before him; 20 for whenever our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and he knows everything. 21 Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, (AO)we have confidence before God; 22 and whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and (AQ)do what pleases him. 23 And this is his commandment, that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and (AS)love one another, (AT)just as he has commanded us. 24 Whoever keeps his commandments abides in God,[d] and God[e] in him. And (AV)by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit whom he has given us. "

This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming and (I)now is in the world already. 4 Little children, you are from God and have overcome them, for he who is in you is greater than (K)he who is in the world. 5 They are from the world; therefore they speak from the world, and (M)the world listens to them. 6 We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know (O)the Spirit of truth and (P)the spirit of error. 7 Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and (R)whoever loves has been born of God and knows God. 8 Anyone who does not love does not know God, because (T)God is love. 9 In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. 10 In this is love, not that we have loved God (W)but that he loved us and sent his Son to be (X)the propitiation for our sins. 11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. 12 No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and (Z)his love is perfected in us. 13 By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit. 14 And we have seen and testify that (AC)the Father has sent his Son to be the Saviour of (AD)the world. 15 Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. 16 So we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. (AG)God is love, and (AH)whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. 17 By this is love perfected with us, so that (AJ)we may have confidence for the day of judgement, because (AK)as he is so also are we in this world. 18 There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not (AM)been perfected in love. 19 We love because he first loved us. 20 If anyone says, I love God, and (AP)hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot[a] love God (AQ)whom he has not seen. 21 And this commandment we have from him: (AS)whoever loves God must also love his brother.

English Standard Version Anglicised,ESVUK,1 John,2,Christ Our Advocate,"My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. 2 He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but (C)also for the sins of the whole world. 3 And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments. 4 Whoever says I know him but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and (F)the truth is not in him, 5 but whoever keeps his word, in him truly (H)the love of God is perfected. (I)By this we may know that we are in him: 6 whoever says he abides in him (K)ought to walk in the same way in which he walked. 7 Beloved, I am writing you no new commandment, but (M)an old commandment (N)that you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word that you have heard. 8 At the same time, it is a new commandment that I am writing to you, which is true in him and in you, because[a] (P)the darkness is passing away and (Q)the true light is already shining. 9 Whoever says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in darkness. 10 Whoever loves his brother abides in the light, and in him[b] there is no cause for stumbling. 11 But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes. 12 I am writing to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven for his name's sake. 13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, children, because you know the Father. 14 I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one. 15 Do not love the world or the things in the world. (AB)If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in the worldthe desires of the flesh and (AD)the desires of the eyes and pride in possessionsis not from the Father but is from the world. 17 And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides for ever. 18 Children, it is the last hour, and as you have heard that (AG)antichrist is coming, so now (AH)many antichrists have come. (AI)Therefore we know that it is the last hour. 19 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for (AK)if they had been of us, they would have continued with us. But they went out, (AL)that it might become plain that they all are not of us. 20 But you have been anointed by (AN)the Holy One, and (AO)you all have knowledge.[c] 21 I write to you, not because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth. 22 Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is (AQ)the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son. 23 No one who denies the Son has the Father. Whoever confesses the Son has the Father also. 24 Let what you heard from the beginning abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then (AT)you too will abide in the Son and in the Father. 25 And this is the promise that he made to us[d]eternal life. 26 I write these things to you about those who are trying to deceive you. 27 But the anointing that you received from him abides in you, and (AX)you have no need that anyone should teach you.

Evangelical Heritage Version,EHV,1 John,5,"Faith, Love, and Obedience","Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the God who has given birth[a] also loves one who has been born of him. 2 This is how we know that we love the children of God: when we love God and keep his commands. 3 In fact, this is love for God: that we keep his commands. And his commands are not burdensome, 4 because everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world: our faith. 5 Who is the one who overcomes the world? Only the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God. 6 This is the one who came by water and blood: Jesus Christ. He did not come by the water alone but by the water and by the blood. The Spirit is the one who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. 7 In fact, there are three that testify:[b] 8 the Spirit, the water, and the blood, and these three are one. 9 If we accept the testimony of people, Gods testimony is even greater, because it is the testimony that God gave about his Son. 10 The one who believes in the Son of God has this testimony in him, but the one who does not believe has made God out to be a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God gave about his Son. 11 This is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12 The one who has the Son has life. The one who does not have the Son of God does not have life. 13 I have written these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life. 14 This is the confidence that we have before him: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. 15 And if we know that he hears uswhatever we askwe also know that we receive the things we have asked from him. 16 If anyone sees his brother committing a sin that does not result in death, he will ask, and God will give lifeto those who commit sin that does not result in death. There is sin that results in death; I am not saying that he should ask about that. 17 All unrighteousness is sin, but there is sin that does not result in death. 18 We know that anyone who has been born of God does not go on sinning. But the one who was born of God protects him,[c] and the Evil One cannot take hold of him. 19 We know that we are from God and that the whole world lies in the grip of the Evil One. 20 We know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding so that we may know him who is true.

Evangelical Heritage Version,EHV,1 John,4,Test the Spirits,"Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see if they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit who confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, 3 and every spirit who does not confess Jesus[a] is not from God.

That is why they speak from a worldly perspective and the world listens to them. 6 We are from God. The one who knows God listens to us, but whoever is not from God does not listen to us.

If we love one another, God remains in us and his love has been brought to its goal in us. 13 This is how we know that we remain in him and he in us: He has given us of his Spirit. 14 We have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. 15 If anyone confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in him and he in God. 16 We also have come to know and trust the love that God has for us. God is love.

Expanded Bible,EXB,1 John,5,Faith in the Son of God,"Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ [Messiah] is Gods child [Lborn of/begotten by God], and whoever loves the Father also loves the Fathers children [Lone born of/begotten by him]. 2 This is how [By/In this] we know we love Gods children: when we love God and obey [perform; carry out] his commands. 3 Loving God means [LFor this is the love of God:] obeying [keeping] his commands. And Gods commands are not too hard [burdensome] for us [Matt. 11:30], 4 because everyone who is a child of [Lborn of; begotten of] God conquers [defeats; overcomes] the world. And this is the victory [conquest] that conquers [defeats; overcomes] the worldour faith. 5 So the one who conquers the world is [or Who is it that conquers/defeats/overcomes the world but?] the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God. 6 Jesus Christ is the One who came by water [Clikely a reference to Jesus baptism] and blood [Ca reference to his death]. He did not come by water only, but by water and blood. And the Spirit says that this is true [is the one who testifies/bears witness; Mark 1:11; John 1:3234], because the Spirit is the truth. 7 So [or For] there are three witnesses[a] [who testify/bear witness]: 8 the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three witnesses agree [Lare one]. 9 We believe people when they say something is true. But what God says is more important [LIf we accept the witness/testimony of people, the witness/testimony of God is better], and he has told us the truth about his own Son [Lbecause this is the witness/testimony God has given about his Son]. 10 Anyone who believes in the Son of God has the truth that God told us [or has the internal testimony of the Holy Spirit; or has the testimony of the eyewitnesses (see 1:14); Lhas the witness/testimony in himself]. Anyone who does not believe makes God a liar [1:10], because that person does not believe what God told us [Lthe witness/testimony that God witnessed/testified to] about his Son. 11 This is what God told us [Lthe witness/testimony]: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12 Whoever has the Son has life, but whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life. 13 I write this letter [LI have written these things] to you who believe in the [Lname of the] Son of God so you will know you have eternal life. 14 And this is the boldness [confidence] we have in Gods presence [Lbefore God; 3:21]: that if we ask God for anything that agrees with what he wants [Laccording to his will], he hears us. 15 [LAnd] If we know he hears us every time we ask him [in whatever we ask], we know we have what we ask from him [3:2122; Mark 11:24]. 16 If anyone sees a brother or sister [Cfellow believer] sinning (sin that does not lead to eternal death [Ldeath]), that person should pray [ask; intercede], and God will give the sinner life.

The reason the Son of God appeared was (U)to destroy the works of the devil. 9 No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's[b] seed abides in him, and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God. 10 By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practise righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who (X)does not love his brother. 11 For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning, (Z)that we should love one another. 12 We should not be like Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? (AB)Because his own deeds were evil and his brother's righteous. 13 Do not be surprised, brothers,[c] that the world hates you. 14 We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. Whoever does not love abides in death. 15 Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that (AF)no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. 16 By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us, and (AH)we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers. 17 But if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet (AJ)closes his heart against him, (AK)how does God's love abide in him? 18 Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and (AM)in truth. 19 By this we shall know that we are of the truth and reassure our heart before him; 20 for whenever our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and he knows everything. 21 Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, (AO)we have confidence before God; 22 and whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and (AQ)do what pleases him. 23 And this is his commandment, that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and (AS)love one another, (AT)just as he has commanded us. 24 Whoever keeps his commandments abides in God,[d] and God[e] in him. And (AV)by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit whom he has given us. "
Expanded Bible,EXB,1 John,2,Jesus Is Our Helper,"My dear children [Llittle children; Ca term of endearment], I write this letter [Lthese things] to you so you will not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have a helper [counselor; advocate; Rom. 8:34] in the presence of the FatherJesus Christ, the One who does what is right [or the Righteous One]. 2 He died in our place to take away [is the atoning sacrifice/Tpropitiation for] our sins [Chis death pays the penalty and removes Gods anger from us; 4:10; Rom. 3:25; Heb. 2:17], and not only our sins but the sins of all people [Lthe whole world]. 3 We can be sure [know] that we know God [Lhim] if we obey [keep] his commands. 4 Anyone who says, I know God [Lhim], but does not obey [keep] Gods [Lhis] commands is a liar, and the truth is not in that person. 5 But if someone obeys [keeps] Gods teaching [Lhis word], then in that person Gods love [or love for God] has truly reached its goal [been fulfilled/perfected/completed]. This is how we can be sure we are living in God [Lin him]: 6 Whoever says that he lives [abides; remains] in God must live [Lwalk] as Jesus lived [Lhe walked]. 7 My dear friends [LBeloved], I am not writing a new command to you but an old command you have had from the beginning [3:23; John 13:34]. It is the teaching [Lword] you have already heard. 8 But also I am writing a new command to you, and you can see its truth in Jesus [Lwhich is true in him] and in you, because [or that] the darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining. 9 Anyone who says [claims; Cas do the false teachers; see 2:1819], I am in the light, [Cfollowing Gods goodness and truthfulness] but hates a brother or sister [Cfellow Christian], is still in the darkness. 10 Whoever loves a brother or sister lives [abides; remains] in the light and will not cause anyone to stumble in his faith [or he will not stumble in his faith; Lthere is no cause of stumbling in him; Cthe stumbling may be either by apostasy or sin; John 6:61; 16:1; Rom. 14:13; Rev. 2:14]. 11 But whoever hates a brother or sister is in darkness, lives [Lwalks] in darkness, and does not know where to go, because the darkness has made that person blind [Lblinded his eyes]. 12 I write to you, dear children [2:1], because your sins are forgiven through Christ [Lon account of his name; Cthe name represents the person]. 13 I write to you, fathers [Cprobably senior members of the congregation], because [or that] you know the One who existed from the beginning [CChrist; John 1:1]. I write to you, young people, because [or that] you have defeated [conquered; overcome] the Evil One. 14 I write [or have written] to you, children, because [or that] you know [have come to know] the Father. I write [or have written] to you, fathers, because [or that] you know [have come to know] the One who existed from the beginning [2:13]. I write [or have written] to you, young people, because [or that] you are strong; the teaching [Lword] of God lives [abides; remains] in you, and you have defeated [conquered; overcome] the Evil One. 15 Do not love the world or the things in [associated with] the world. If you love the world, the love of [or for] the Father is not in you [James 4:4]. 16 [LFor] These are the ways of [All that is in/associated with] the world: wanting to please our sinful selves [Lthe desire/lust of the flesh], wanting the sinful things we see [Lthe desire/lust of the eyes], and being too proud of what we have [Lthe pride of life/possessions]. None of these come from the Father, but all of them come from the world. 17 The world and everything that people want in it [Lits desire/lust] are passing away [1 Cor. 7:31], but the person who does what God wants [the will of God] lives [abides; remains] forever. 18 My dear children [2:1], these are the last days [Lit is the last hour; Csuggesting urgency, though not claiming the end was near]. [LJust as] You have heard that the enemy of Christ [Lantichrist] is coming, and now many enemies of Christ [Lantichrists; Cfalse teachers; 2:22; 2 John 7] are already here. This is how we know that these are the last days [Lit is the last hour]. 19 These enemies of Christ were in our fellowship, but they left us [LThey went out from us; Cprobably to form a rival fellowship]. They never really belonged to us [LBut they were not of us]; [LFor] if they had been a part of us, they would have stayed [remained; abided] with us. But they left, and this shows [or so that it would be shown] that none of them really belonged to us. 20 You have the gift [Lanointing; Cprobably the Holy Spirit and/or the spiritual gift of the Word of God applied to their hearts; v. 24; 1 Sam. 16:13; Is. 61:1; John 16:13; 2 Cor. 1:2122] that the Holy One gave you [Lfrom the Holy One; Ca reference to God the Father (Ps. 71:22) or more likely Jesus Christ (Mark 1:24; John 6:69)], so you all know the truth[a] [or have knowledge; Lknow]. 21 I do not write to you because you do not know the truth but because you do know the truth. And you know that no lie comes from the truth. 22 Who is the liar? It is the person who does not accept [denies; repudiates] Jesus as the Christ [Messiah; Anointed One]. This is the enemy of Christ [Lantichrist]: the person who does not accept [denies; repudiates] the Father and his [the] Son. 23 Whoever does not accept [denies; repudiates] the Son does not have the Father. But whoever confesses [acknowledges; accepts] the Son has the Father, too. 24 [LAs for you] Be sure you continue to follow [abide/remain in] the teaching [Lwhat] you heard from the beginning [Cwhen they first became Christians; 1 Tim. 6:3; 2 Tim. 1:13; Titus 1:9; 2 Pet. 3:2; Jude 17, 20]. If you continue to follow [abide/remain in] what you heard from the beginning, you will [Lalso; indeed] stay [abide; remain] in the Son and in the Father. 25 And this is what the Son [Lthe promise which he himself] promised to uslife forever [eternal life; 1 Tim. 4:8; 2 Tim. 1:1]. 26 I am writing [or have written] this letter [Lthese things] about those people who are trying to lead you the wrong way [deceiving you; leading you astray]. 27 [LAs for you] Christ gave you a special gift that is still in you [LThe anointing that you received from him abides/remains in you; 2:20], so you do not need any other teacher [Lanyone to teach you; Jer. 31:34]. [LBut just as] His gift [Lanointing] teaches you about everything, and it is true, not false. So continue to live in Christ, as his gift taught you [Ljust as he taught you, abide/remain in him]. 28 Yes [Now], my dear children [2:1], live [abide; remain] in him so that when Christ comes back [Lhe appears/is revealed], we can be without fear [confident] and not be ashamed [Lof him] in his presence [at his coming]. 29 Since [If] you know that Christ [Lhe] is righteous, you know that all who do right [practice righteousness] are Gods children [Lhave been born of/begotten by him].

And (G)his commandments are not burdensome. 4 For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world(I)our faith. 5 Who is it that overcomes the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? 6 This is he who came by water and bloodJesus Christ; not by the water only but by the water and the blood. And (L)the Spirit is the one who testifies, because (M)the Spirit is the truth. 7 For there are three that testify: 8 the Spirit and the water and the blood; and these three agree. 9 If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater, for this is the testimony of God (O)that he has borne concerning his Son. 10 Whoever believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. Whoever does not believe God (Q)has made him a liar, (R)because he has not believed in the testimony that God has borne concerning his Son. 11 And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and (T)this life is in his Son. 12 Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life. 13 I write these things to you who (W)believe in the name of the Son of God that you may know that you have eternal life. 14 And this is the confidence that we have towards him, that (Y)if we ask anything according to his will he hears us. 15 And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests that we have asked of him. 16 If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death, he shall ask, and God[a] will give him lifeto those who commit sins that do not lead to death. (AA)There is sin that leads to death; (AB)I do not say that one should pray for that. 17 All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that does not lead to death. 18 We know that everyone who has been born of God does not keep on sinning, but (AE)he who was born of God (AF)protects him, and the evil one does not touch him. 19 We know that we are from God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one. 20 And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know (AI)him who is true; and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ.

GODS WORD Translation,GW,1 John,2,Those Who Know Christ Obey His Commandments,"My dear children, Im writing this to you so that you will not sin. Yet, if anyone does sin, we have Jesus Christ, who has Gods full approval. He speaks on our behalf when we come into the presence of the Father. 2 He is the payment for our sins, and not only for our sins, but also for the sins of the whole world. 3 We are sure that we know Christ if we obey his commandments. 4 The person who says, I know him, but doesnt obey his commandments is a liar. The truth isnt in that person. 5 But whoever obeys what Christ says is the kind of person in whom Gods love is perfected. Thats how we know we are in Christ. 6 Those who say that they live in him must live the same way he lived. 7 Dear friends, its not as though Im writing to give you a new commandment. Rather, Im giving you an old commandment that youve had from the beginning. Its the old commandment youve already heard. 8 On the other hand, Im writing to give you a new commandment. Its a truth that exists in Christ and in you: The darkness is fading, and the true light is already shining. 9 Those who say that they are in the light but hate other believers are still in the dark. 10 Those who love other believers live in the light. Nothing will destroy the faith of those who live in the light. 11 Those who hate other believers are in the dark and live in the dark. They dont know where theyre going, because they cant see in the dark. 12 Im writing to you, dear children, because your sins are forgiven through Christ. 13 Im writing to you, fathers, because you know Christ who has existed from the beginning. Im writing to you, young people, because you have won the victory over the evil one. 14 Ive written to you, children, because you know the Father. Ive written to you, fathers, because you know Christ, who has existed from the beginning. Ive written to you, young people, because you are strong and Gods word lives in you. You have won the victory over the evil one. 15 Dont love the world and what it offers. Those who love the world dont have the Fathers love in them. 16 Not everything that the world offersphysical gratification, greed, and extravagant lifestylescomes from the Father. It comes from the world, and 17 the world and its evil desires are passing away. But the person who does what God wants lives forever. 18 Children, its the end of time. Youve heard that an antichrist is coming. Certainly, many antichrists are already here. Thats how we know its the end of time. 19 They left us. However, they were never really part of us. If they had been, they would have stayed with us. But by leaving they made it clear that none of them were part of us. 20 The Holy One has anointed you, so all of you have knowledge. 21 Im writing to you because you know the truth, not because you dont know the truth. You know that no lie ever comes from the truth. 22 Who is a liar? Who else but the person who rejects Jesus as the Messiah? The person who rejects the Father and the Son is an antichrist. 23 Everyone who rejects the Son doesnt have the Father either. The person who acknowledges the Son also has the Father. 24 Make sure that the message you heard from the beginning lives in you. If that message lives in you, you will also live in the Son and in the Father. 25 Christ has given us the promise of eternal life. 26 Im writing to you about those who are trying to deceive you. 27 The anointing you received from Christ lives in you. You dont need anyone to teach you something else. Instead, Christs anointing teaches you about everything. His anointing is true and contains no lie. So live in Christ as he taught you to do. 28 Now, dear children, live in Christ. Then, when he appears we will have confidence, and when he comes we wont turn from him in shame. 29 If you know that Christ has Gods approval, you also know that everyone who does what God approves of has been born from God. "
GODS WORD Translation,GW,1 John,1,Johns Reason for Writing,"The Word of life existed from the beginning. We have heard it. We have seen it. We observed and touched it. 2 This life was revealed to us. We have seen it, and we testify about it. We are reporting to you about this eternal life that was in the presence of the Father and was revealed to us. 3 This is the life we have seen and heard. We are reporting about it to you also so that you, too, can have a relationship with us. Our relationship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. 4 We are writing this so that we can be completely filled with joy. 5 This is the message we heard from Christ and are reporting to you: God is light, and there isnt any darkness in him. 6 If we say, We have a relationship with God and yet live in the dark, were lying. We arent being truthful. 7 But if we live in the light in the same way that God is in the light, we have a relationship with each other. And the blood of his Son Jesus cleanses us from every sin. 8 If we say, We arent sinful we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 9 God is faithful and reliable. If we confess our sins, he forgives them and cleanses us from everything weve done wrong. 10 If we say, We have never sinned, we turn God into a liar and his Word is not in us. "
1599 Geneva Bible,GNV,1 John,4,,"1 Having spoken somewhat touching the trying of spirits:4 For some speak after the world,5 and some after God.7 He returneth to charity,11, 19 and by the example of God he exhorteth to brotherly love. 1 Dearly [a]beloved, believe not every [b]spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: for many false Prophets are gone out into the world. 2 [c]Hereby shall ye know the Spirit of God, [d]Every spirit which confesseth that [e]Jesus Christ is come in the [f]flesh is of God. 3 And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not of God: but this is the spirit of Antichrist, of whom ye have heard, how that he should come, and now already he is in this world. 4 [g]Little children, ye are of God, and have overcome them: for greater is he that is in you, than he that is in this world. 5 [h]They are of this world, therefore spake they of this world, and this world heareth them. 6 [i]We are of God, he that knoweth God, heareth us: he that is not of God heareth us not. Hereby know we the [j]Spirit of truth, and the spirit of error. 7 [k]Beloved, let us love one another: [l]for love cometh of God, and everyone that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. 8 He that loveth not, knoweth not God, [m]for God is [n]love. 9 Herein was that love of God made manifest amongst us, because God sent that his only begotten Son into this world, that we might live through him. 10 Herein is that love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be a reconciliation for our sins. 11 [o]Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. 12 [p]No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is [q]perfect in us. 13 Hereby know we, that we dwell in him, and he in us: because he hath given us of his Spirit. 14 [r]And we have seen, and do testify, that the Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the world. 15 Whosoever [s]confesseth that Jesus is the Son of God, in him dwelleth God, and he in God. 16 And we have known, and believed the love that God hath in us, [t]God is love, and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him. 17 [u]Herein is that love perfect in us, that we should have boldness in the day of judgment: for [v]as he is, even so are we in this world. 18 There is no [w]fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear: for fear hath painfulness: and he that feareth, is not perfect in love. 19 [x]We love him, because he loved us first. 20 [y]If any man say, I love God, and hate his brother, he is a liar: [z]for how can he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, love God whom he hath not seen? 21 [aa]And this commandment have we of him, that he that loveth God, should love his brother also. "
1599 Geneva Bible,GNV,1 John,5,,"1 He showeth that brotherly love and faith are things inseparable:10 And that there is no faith towards God, but by believing in Christ:14 Hence proceedeth calling upon God with assurance:16 and also that our prayers be available for our brethren. 1 Whosoever [a]believeth that Jesus is that [b]Christ, is born of God: and everyone that loveth him, which begat, loveth [c]him also which is begotten of him. 2 [d]In this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his [e]commandments. 3 [f]For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: [g]and his commandments are not [h]burdenous. 4 [i]For all that is born of God, overcometh this world: [j]and this is that victory that [k]hath overcome this world even our [l]faith. 5 [m]Who is it that overcometh this world, but he which believeth that Jesus is that Son of God? 6 [n]This is that Jesus Christ that came by water and blood: [o]not by water only, but by water and blood: and it is that [p]Spirit that beareth witness: for that Spirit is truth. 7 For there are three, which bear record in heaven, the Father, the [q]Word, and the holy Ghost: and these three are [r]one. 8 And there are three, which bear record in the earth, the Spirit, and the Water and the Blood: and these three agree in one. 9 [s]If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for [t]this is the witness of God, which he testified of his Son. 10 [u]He that believeth in that Son of God, hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God, hath made him a liar, because he believed not the record, that God witnessed of that his Son. 11 [v]And this is that record, to wit, that God hath given unto us eternal life, and this life is in that his Son. 12 He that hath that Son, hath that life: and he that hath not that Son of God, hath not that life. 13 [w]These things have I written unto you, that believe in the name of that Son of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe in the Name of that Son of God. 14 [x]And this is that assurance that we have in him, that if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us. 15 And if we know that he heareth us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions, that we have desired of him. 16 [y]If any man see his brother sin a sin that is not unto death, let him [z]ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death, I say not that thou shouldest pray for it. 17 [aa]All unrighteousness is sin, but there is a sin not unto death. 18 [ab]We know that whosoever is born of God, sinneth not: but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not. 19 [ac]We know that we are of God, and this whole world lieth in wickedness. 20 But we know that that Son of God is come, and hath given us a mind to know him, which is true, and we are in him that is true, that is, in that his Son Jesus Christ, the same is that very [ad]God, and that eternal life. 21 [ae]Little children, keep yourselves from idols, Amen.

Expanded Bible,EXB,1 John,3,We Are Gods Children,"The Father has loved us so much [LSee what sort of love the Father has given us!] that we are called children of God. And we really are his children [LAnd we are!]. The reason the people in the world do [Lthe world does] not know us is that they have not known him. 2 Dear friends [LBeloved], now we are children of God, and we have not yet been shown [it has not yet been revealed] what we will be in the future. But we know that when Christ comes again [Lhe/it is revealed], we will be like him, because we will see him as he really is. 3 And all who have this hope in Christ [Lhim] keep themselves pure, just as Christ [Lhe] is pure. 4 The person [LEveryone] who sins [commits sin] breaks Gods law [commits lawlessness/iniquity; Creferring to the false teachers; 2:1920]. Yes, sin is living against Gods law [lawlessness; iniquity]. 5 You know that Christ came [Lhe has appeared/was revealed] to take away sins and that there is no sin in Christ [Lhim]. 6 So anyone who lives [abides; remains] in Christ [Lhim] does not go on sinning [or sin; Cthe Christian ideal, an implicit call to avoid sin]. Anyone who goes on sinning [or sins] has never really understood Christ and has never known him [Lneither seen him nor known him]. 7 Dear children [2:1], do not let anyone lead you the wrong way [deceive you]. The one who does what is right is righteous, just as Christ [Lhe] is righteous. 8 Anyone who continues to sin [or sins] belongs to the devil [John 8:44], because the devil has been sinning since the beginning. The Son of God came [was revealed; appeared] for this purpose: to destroy the devils work [Matt. 4:111; 12:2529; Luke 10:18; John 12:31; Rev. 12:712; 20:13]. 9 Those [LAll] who are Gods children [Lborn of/begotten by God; 2:29] do not continue sinning [or sin], because the new life from God [or Gods message; or Gods Spirit; Lhis seed/sperm] remains [abides] in them. They are not able to go on sinning [or sin], because they have become children of God [Lare born of/begotten by God]. 10 So we can see [LIn this way it is apparent/revealed/evident] who Gods children are and who the devils children are: Those who do not do what is right [practice righteousness] are not Gods children [Lfrom/of God], and those who do not love their brothers and sisters are not Gods children [Lfrom/of God]. 11 This is the teaching [message] you have heard from the beginning: We must love each other [Cas Jesus himself taught: John 13:3435; 15:12]. 12 Do not be like Cain who belonged to the Evil One and killed [murdered] his brother [Gen. 4; John 8:44]. And why did he kill [murder] him? Because the things Cain did were evil, and the things his brother did were good [righteous; just]. 13 Brothers and sisters [Cfellow believers], do not be surprised [be amazed; wonder] when [or that; or if] the people of the world hate [Lthe world hates] you. 14 We know we have left death and have come into life [passed/crossed from death to life; John 5:24] because we love each other [Lthe brothers and sisters]. Whoever does not love is still dead [abides/remains/continues in death]. 15 Everyone who hates a brother or sister [Cfellow believer] is a murderer [Cbecause they have killed that person in their heart; Matt. 5:2126], and you know that no murderers have eternal life [Labiding; remaining] in them. 16 This is how we know what real love is: Jesus [Lhe] gave [laid down] his life for us [John 15:13]. So we should give [lay down] our lives for our brothers and sisters [Cfellow believers; John 15:12]. 17 Suppose someone has enough to live [Lthe worlds possessions/goods] and sees a brother or sister [Cfellow believer] in need, but does not help [Lcloses off his heart/compassion from him]. Then Gods love is not living in that person [LHow does Gods love abide/remain in him?]. 18 My children [2:1], we should love people not only with words and talk [Lin word and tongue], but by our actions and true caring [or by showing true love through our actions; Lin deed and truth]. This is the way [LBy this] we know [Lwill know; Cperhaps in a future moment of crisis] that we belong to the way of truth [Ltruth]. When [or If] our hearts [Cour conscience] make us feel guilty [condemn/convict us], we can still have peace before God [our hearts can be reassured before him]. God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything [1 Cor. 4:35]. 21 My dear friends [LBeloved], if our hearts do not make us feel guilty [condemn/convict us], we can come without fear into Gods presence [Lhave boldness/confidence before God]. 22 And God gives us [Lwe receive from him] what we ask for because we obey Gods [Lhis] commands and do what pleases him [John 14:14; 16:23]. 23 This is what God commands [Lhis command]: that we believe in [Lthe name of] his Son, Jesus Christ, and that we love each other, just as he commanded. 24 The people who obey [keep] Gods commands live [abide; remain] in God, and God lives [abides; remains] in them. We know that God lives [abides; remains] in us because of [by; from] the Spirit God gave us. "
Expanded Bible,EXB,1 John,4,Warning Against False Teachers,"My dear friends [LBeloved], many false prophets [Deut. 13:15; 18:1422; Mark 13:22] have gone out into the world. So do not believe [trust] every spirit, but test the spirits to see if they are from God [Cthe false teachers evidently claimed that their teaching was from the Spirit; 1 Cor. 12:13; 14:29; 1 Thess. 5:1921]. 2 This is how you can know [recognize] Gods Spirit: Every spirit [Ca teacher/prophet claiming inspiration from the Spirit] who confesses [acknowledges] that Jesus Christ came to earth as a human [Lin the flesh] is from God. 3 And every spirit who refuses to say this about Jesus [Ldoes not confess/acknowledge Jesus] is not from God [2 John 7]. It is the spirit of the enemy of Christ [Lantichrist; 2:18, 22], which you have heard is coming, and now he is already in the world. 4 My dear children [2:1], you belong to [Lare from] God and have defeated [conquered; overcome] them [Cthe antichrists/false teachers]; because Gods Spirit, who is in you, is greater than the devil, who is in the world [Lthat which is in you is greater than that which is in the world]. 5 And they belong to [Lare from] the world, so what they say is from the world, and the world listens to [hears; obeys] them. 6 But we belong to [are from] God, and those who know God listen to [hear; obey] us. But those who are not from God do not listen to [hear; obey] us. That is how we know [recognize] the Spirit that is true and the spirit that is false [deceives; errs]. 7 Dear friends [LBeloved], we should [let us] love each other, because love comes from God. Everyone who loves has become Gods child [Lbeen begotten/fathered by God] and knows God. 8 Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. 9 This is how God showed [revealed] his love to us: He sent his one and only Son into the world so that we could have life through him. 10 This is what real love is: It is not our love for God; it is Gods love for us. He sent his Son to die in our place to take away our sins [as the atoning sacrifice/Tpropitiation for our sins; see 2:2]. 11 Dear friends [Beloved], if God loved us that much [or in this way; John 3:16] we also should love each other. 12 No one has ever seen God [CGod the Father; John 1:18], but if we love each other, God lives [remains; abides] in [or among] us, and his love is made perfect [is made complete; comes to full expression] in us. 13 [LBy this] We know that we live [abide; remain] in God and he lives [abides; remains] in us, because he gave us [Lof; from; 3:24] his Spirit [Cwe share in his Spirit]. 14 We have seen and can testify [witness; proclaim] that the Father sent his Son to be [or as] the Savior of the world. 15 Whoever confesses [acknowledges] that Jesus is the Son of God has God living [abiding; remaining] inside, and that person lives [abides; remains] in God. 16 And so we know [have come to know] the love that God has for us, and we trust [believe; rely on] that love. God is love. Those who live [abide; remain] in love live [abide; remain] in God, and God lives [abides; remains] in them. 17 This is how love is made perfect [is made complete; comes to full expression] in [or among] us: that we can be without fear [have boldness; have confidence; 2:28; 3:21; 5:14] on the day of judgment, because in this world we are like him [Cprobably referring to Christ, our example of love]. 18 Where Gods love is, there is no fear [LThere is no fear in love], because Gods perfect love drives out fear [Tperfect love casts out fear]. It is punishment that makes a person fear, so love is not made perfect [complete] in the person who fears [Cfear of punishment, not an appropriate fear of God; compare Prov. 1:7; 2 Cor. 7:15; Phil. 2:12]. 19 We love because God [Lhe] first loved us. 20 If people say, I love God, but hate their brothers or sisters [Cfellow believers], they are liars. [LFor] Those who do not love their brothers and sisters [Cfellow believers], whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have never seen. 21 And God gave us this command [Lwe have this command from him]: Those who love God must also love their brothers and sisters [Cfellow believers; John 13:34].

1599 Geneva Bible,GNV,1 John,3,,"1 Setting down the inestimable glory of this that we are Gods sons,7 he showeth that newness of life must be testifieth by good works, whereof charity is a manifest token.19 Of faith, 22 and praying unto God. 1 Behold, [a][b]what love the Father hath given to us, that we should be [c]called the sons of God: [d]For this cause this world knoweth you not, because it knoweth not him. 2 [e]Dearly beloved, now are we the sons of God, but yet it is not made manifest what we shall be: and we know that when he shall be made manifest: we shall be [f]like him: for we shall see him [g]as he is. 3 [h]And every man that hath this hope in him purgeth himself, even [i]as he is pure. 4 [j]Whosoever [k]commiteth sin, transgresseth also the Law: for [l]sin is the transgression of the Law. 5 [m]And ye know that he was made manifest, that he might take away our sins, and in him is no sin. 6 Whosoever abideth in him, sinneth not: whosoever [n]sinneth, hath not seen him, neither hath known him. 7 [o]Little children, let no man deceive you, he that doeth righteousness, is righteous, as he is righteous. 8 [p]He that commiteth sin, is of the [q]devil: for the devil [r]sinneth from the [s]beginning: for this purpose was made manifest that Son of God, that he might loose the works of the devil. 9 Whosoever is born of God sinneth not: for his [t]seed remaineth in him, neither can he sin, because he is born of God. 10 [u]In this are the children of God known, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness, is not of God, [v]neither he that loveth not his brother. 11 [w]For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another, 12 [x]Not as [y]Cain which was of that wicked one, and slew his brother: [z]and wherefore slew he him? because his own works were evil, and his brothers good. 13 Marvel not my brethren, though this world hate you. 14 [aa]We know that we are [ab]translated from death unto life, because we love the brethren: he that loveth not his brother, abideth in death. 15 [ac]Whosoever hateth his brother, is a manslayer: and ye know that no manslayer hath eternal life abiding in him. 16 [ad]Hereby have we perceived love, that he laid down his life for us: therefore we ought also to lay down our lives for the brethren. 17 [ae]And whosoever hath this [af]worlds good, and seeth his brother have need, and [ag]shutteth up his compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him? 18 [ah]My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue only, but in deed and in truth. 19 [ai]For thereby we know that we are of the truth, [aj]and shall before him assure our hearts. 20 For [ak]if our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. 21 [al]Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we boldness toward God. 22 [am]And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things which are pleasing in his sight. 23 This is then his commandment, that we believe in the Name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave commandment. 24 For he that keepeth his commandments, dwelleth in him, and he in him: and hereby we know that he abideth in us, even by that [an]Spirit which he hath given us.

GODS WORD Translation,GW,1 John,3,Love One Another,"Consider this: The Father has given us his love. He loves us so much that we are actually called Gods dear children. And thats what we are. For this reason the world doesnt recognize us, and it didnt recognize him either. 2 Dear friends, now we are Gods children. What we will be isnt completely clear yet. We do know that when Christ appears we will be like him because we will see him as he is. 3 So all people who have this confidence in Christ keep themselves pure, as Christ is pure. 4 Those who live sinful lives are disobeying God. Sin is disobedience. 5 You know that Christ appeared in order to take away our sins. He isnt sinful. 6 Those who live in Christ dont go on sinning. Those who go on sinning havent seen or known Christ. 7 Dear children, dont let anyone deceive you. Whoever does what God approves of has Gods approval as Christ has Gods approval. 8 The person who lives a sinful life belongs to the devil, because the devil has been committing sin since the beginning. The reason that the Son of God appeared was to destroy what the devil does. 9 Those who have been born from God dont live sinful lives. What God has said lives in them, and they cant live sinful lives. They have been born from God. 10 This is the way Gods children are distinguished from the devils children. Everyone who doesnt do what is right or love other believers isnt Gods child. 11 The message that you have heard from the beginning is to love each other. 12 Dont be like Cain. He was a child of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did Cain murder his brother? Because the things Cain did were evil and the things his brother did had Gods approval. 13 Brothers and sisters, dont be surprised if the world hates you. 14 We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love other believers. The person who doesnt grow in love remains in death. 15 Everyone who hates another believer is a murderer, and you know that a murderer doesnt have eternal life. 16 We understand what love is when we realize that Christ gave his life for us. That means we must give our lives for other believers. 17 Now, suppose a person has enough to live on and notices another believer in need. How can Gods love be in that person if he doesnt bother to help the other believer? 18 Dear children, we must show love through actions that are sincere, not through empty words. 19 This is how we will know that we belong to the truth and how we will be reassured in his presence. 20 Whenever our conscience condemns us, we will be reassured that God is greater than our conscience and knows everything. 21 Dear friends, if our conscience doesnt condemn us, we can boldly look to God 22 and receive from him anything we ask. We receive it because we obey his commandments and do what pleases him. 23 This is his commandment: to believe in his Son, the one named Jesus Christ, and to love each other as he commanded us. 24 Those who obey Christs commandments live in God, and God lives in them. We know that he lives in us because he has given us the Spirit. "
Good News Translation,GNT,1 John,3,Children of God,"See how much the Father has loved us! His love is so great that we are called God's childrenand so, in fact, we are. This is why the world does not know us: it has not known God. 2 My dear friends, we are now God's children, but it is not yet clear what we shall become. But we know that when Christ appears, we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he really is. 3 Everyone who has this hope in Christ keeps himself pure, just as Christ is pure. 4 Whoever sins is guilty of breaking God's law, because sin is a breaking of the law. 5 You know that Christ appeared in order to take away sins,[a] and that there is no sin in him. 6 So everyone who lives in union with Christ does not continue to sin; but whoever continues to sin has never seen him or known him. 7 Let no one deceive you, my children! Whoever does what is right is righteous, just as Christ is righteous. 8 Whoever continues to sin belongs to the Devil, because the Devil has sinned from the very beginning. The Son of God appeared for this very reason, to destroy what the Devil had done. 9 Those who are children of God do not continue to sin, for God's very nature is in them; and because God is their Father, they cannot continue to sin. 10 Here is the clear difference between God's children and the Devil's children: those who do not do what is right or do not love others are not God's children. 11 The message you heard from the very beginning is this: we must love one another. 12 We must not be like Cain; he belonged to the Evil One and murdered his own brother Abel. Why did Cain murder him? Because the things he himself did were wrong, and the things his brother did were right. 13 So do not be surprised, my friends, if the people of the world hate you. 14 We know that we have left death and come over into life; we know it because we love others. Those who do not love are still under the power of death. 15 Those who hate others are murderers, and you know that murderers do not have eternal life in them. 16 This is how we know what love is: Christ gave his life for us. We too, then, ought to give our lives for others! 17 If we are rich and see others in need, yet close our hearts against them, how can we claim that we love God? 18 My children, our love should not be just words and talk; it must be true love, which shows itself in action. 19 This, then, is how we will know that we belong to the truth; this is how we will be confident in God's presence. 20 If our conscience condemns us, we know that God is greater than our conscience and that he knows everything. 21 And so, my dear friends, if our conscience does not condemn us, we have courage in God's presence. 22 We receive from him whatever we ask, because we obey his commands and do what pleases him. 23 What he commands is that we believe in his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as Christ commanded us. 24 Those who obey God's commands live in union with God and God lives in union with them. And because of the Spirit that God has given us we know that God lives in union with us. "
Holman Christian Standard Bible,HCSB,1 John,2,Gods Commands,"My little children, I am writing you these things so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the FatherJesus Christ the Righteous One. 2 He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not only for ours, but also for those of the whole world.(C) 3 This is how we are sure that we have come to know Him: by keeping His commands.(E) 4 The one who says, I have come to know Him, yet doesn't keep His commands, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 5 But whoever keeps His word, truly in him the love of God is perfected.[a] This is how we know we are in Him:(G) 6 The one who says he remains in Him should walk just as He walked. 7 Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old command that you have had from the beginning. The old command is the message(J) you have heard. 8 Yet I am writing you a new command, which is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light(L) is already shining.(M) 9 The one who says he is in the light but hates his brother is in the darkness until now. 10 The one who loves his brother remains in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling in him.[b] 11 But the one who hates his brother is in the darkness, walks in the darkness,(Q) and doesnt know where hes going,(R) because the darkness has blinded his eyes. 12 I am writing to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven because of Jesus name. 13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you have come to know the One who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have had victory over the evil one. 14 I have written to you, children, because you have come to know the Father. I have written to you, fathers, because you have come to know the One who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, Gods word remains in you, and you have had victory over the evil one. 15 Do not love the world or the things that belong to[c] the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in him. 16 For everything that belongs to[d] the worldthe lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes,(Y) and the pride(Z) in ones lifestyleis not from the Father, but is from the world. 17 And the world with its lust is passing away, but the one who does Gods will(AB) remains forever.(AC) 18 Children, it is the last hour. And as you have heard, Antichrist(AE) is coming, even now many antichrists have come. We know from this that it is the last hour. 19 They went out from us, but they did not belong to us; for if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us. However, they went out so that it might be made clear that none of them belongs to us. 20 But you have an anointing from the Holy One,(AG) and all of you have knowledge.[e] 21 I have not written to you because you dont know the truth, but because you do know it, and because no lie comes from the truth. 22 Who is the liar, if not the one who denies that Jesus is the Messiah? This one is the antichrist: the one who denies the Father and the Son. 23 No one who denies the Son can have the Father; he who confesses the Son has the Father as well.(AJ) 24 What you have heard from the beginning must remain in you. If what you have heard from the beginning remains in you, then you will remain in the Son and in the Father.(AL) 25 And this is the promise that He Himself made to us: eternal life. 26 I have written these things to you about those who are trying to deceive you. 27 The anointing you received from Him remains in you, and you dont need anyone to teach you. Instead, His anointing teaches you about all things and is true and is not a lie; just as He has taught you, remain in Him.(AO) 28 So now, little children, remain in Him, so that when He appears we may have boldness and not be ashamed before Him at His coming.(AQ) 29 If you know that He is righteous, you know this as well: Everyone who does what is right has been born of Him.(AS) "
Good News Translation,GNT,1 John,2,Christ Our Helper,"I am writing this to you, my children, so that you will not sin; but if anyone does sin, we have someone who pleads with the Father on our behalfJesus Christ, the righteous one. 2 And Christ himself is the means by which our sins are forgiven, and not our sins only, but also the sins of everyone. 3 If we obey God's commands, then we are sure that we know him. 4 If we say that we know him, but do not obey his commands, we are liars and there is no truth in us. 5 But if we obey his word, we are the ones whose love for God has really been made perfect. This is how we can be sure that we are in union with God: 6 if we say that we remain in union with God, we should live just as Jesus Christ did. 7 My dear friends, this command I am writing you is not new; it is the old command, the one you have had from the very beginning. The old command is the message you have already heard. 8 However, the command I now write you is new, because its truth is seen in Christ and also in you. For the darkness is passing away, and the real light is already shining. 9 If we say that we are in the light, yet hate others, we are in the darkness to this very hour. 10 If we love others, we live in the light, and so there is nothing in us that will cause someone else[a] to sin. 11 But if we hate others, we are in the darkness; we walk in it and do not know where we are going, because the darkness has made us blind. 12 I write to you, my children, because your sins are forgiven for the sake of Christ. 13 I write to you, fathers, because you know him who has existed from the beginning. I write to you, young people, because you have defeated the Evil One. 14 I write to you, my children, because you know the Father. I write to you, fathers, because you know him who has existed from the beginning. I write to you, young people, because you are strong; the word of God lives in you, and you have defeated the Evil One. 15 Do not love the world or anything that belongs to the world. If you love the world, you do not love the Father. 16 Everything that belongs to the worldwhat the sinful self desires, what people see and want, and everything in this world that people are so proud ofnone of this comes from the Father; it all comes from the world. 17 The world and everything in it that people desire is passing away; but those who do the will of God live forever. 18 My children, the end is near! You were told that the Enemy of Christ would come; and now many enemies of Christ have already appeared, and so we know that the end is near. 19 These people really did not belong to our fellowship, and that is why they left us; if they had belonged to our fellowship, they would have stayed with us. But they left so that it might be clear that none of them really belonged to us. 20 But you have had the Holy Spirit poured out on you by Christ, and so all of you know the truth. 21 I write you, then, not because you do not know the truth; instead, it is because you do know it, and you also know that no lie ever comes from the truth. 22 Who, then, is the liar? It is those who say that Jesus is not the Messiah. Such people are the Enemy of Christthey reject both the Father and the Son. 23 For those who reject the Son reject also the Father; those who accept the Son have the Father also. 24 Be sure, then, to keep in your hearts the message you heard from the beginning. If you keep that message, then you will always live in union with the Son and the Father. 25 And this is what Christ himself promised to give useternal life. 26 I am writing this to you about those who are trying to deceive you. 27 But as for you, Christ has poured out his Spirit on you. As long as his Spirit remains in you, you do not need anyone to teach you. For his Spirit teaches you about everything, and what he teaches is true, not false. Obey the Spirit's teaching, then, and remain in union with Christ. 28 Yes, my children, remain in union with him, so that when he appears we may be full of courage and need not hide in shame from him on the Day he comes. 29 You know that Christ is righteous; you should know, then, that everyone who does what is right is God's child. "
Good News Translation,GNT,1 John,5,Our Victory over the World,"Whoever believes that Jesus is the Messiah is a child of God; and whoever loves a father loves his child also. 2 This is how we know that we love God's children: it is by loving God and obeying his commands. 3 For our love for God means that we obey his commands. And his commands are not too hard for us, 4 because every child of God is able to defeat the world. And we win the victory over the world by means of our faith. 5 Who can defeat the world? Only the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God. 6 Jesus Christ is the one who came with the water of his baptism and the blood of his death. He came not only with the water, but with both the water and the blood. And the Spirit himself testifies that this is true, because the Spirit is truth. 7 There are three witnesses: 8 the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and all three give the same testimony. 9 We believe human testimony; but God's testimony is much stronger, and he has given this testimony about his Son. 10 So those who believe in the Son of God have this testimony in their own heart; but those who do not believe God, have made a liar of him, because they have not believed what God has said about his Son. 11 The testimony is this: God has given us eternal life, and this life has its source in his Son. 12 Whoever has the Son has this life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life. 13 I am writing this to you so that you may know that you have eternal lifeyou that believe in the Son of God. 14 We have courage in God's presence, because we are sure that he hears us if we ask him for anything that is according to his will. 15 He hears us whenever we ask him; and since we know this is true, we know also that he gives us what we ask from him. 16 If you see a believer commit a sin that does not lead to death, you should pray to God, who will give that person life. This applies to those whose sins do not lead to death. But there is sin which leads to death, and I do not say that you should pray to God about that. 17 All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin which does not lead to death. 18 We know that no children of God keep on sinning, for the Son of God keeps them safe, and the Evil One cannot harm them. 19 We know that we belong to God even though the whole world is under the rule of the Evil One. 20 We know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we know the true God. We live in union with the true Godin union with his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and this is eternal life. 21 My children, keep yourselves safe from false gods! "
Holman Christian Standard Bible,HCSB,1 John,1,Prologue: Our Declaration,"What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have observed and have touched with our hands, concerning the Word of life 2 that life was revealed, and we have seen it and we testify and declare to you the eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us 3 what we have seen and heard we also declare to you, so that you may have fellowship along with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. 4 We are writing these things[a] so that our[b] joy may be complete. 5 Now this is the message we have heard from Him and declare to you: God is light, and there is absolutely no darkness in Him.(I) 6 If we say, We have fellowship with Him, yet we walk in darkness,(K) we are lying and are not practicing[c] the truth.(L) 7 But if we walk in the light as He Himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus(N) His Son cleanses us from all sin. 8 If we say, We have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 10 If we say, We dont have any sin, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.(R) "
GODS WORD Translation,GW,1 John,4,Test People Who Say They Have Gods Spirit,"Dear friends, dont believe all people who say that they have the Spirit. Instead, test them. See whether the spirit they have is from God, because there are many false prophets in the world. 2 This is how you can recognize Gods Spirit: Every person who declares that Jesus Christ has come as a human has the Spirit that is from God. 3 But every person who doesnt declare that Jesus Christ has come as a human has a spirit that isnt from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist that you have heard is coming. That spirit is already in the world. 4 Dear children, you belong to God. So you have won the victory over these people, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. 5 These people belong to the world. Thats why they speak the thoughts of the world, and the world listens to them. 6 We belong to God. The person who knows God listens to us. Whoever doesnt belong to God doesnt listen to us. Thats how we can tell the Spirit of truth from the spirit of lies. 7 Dear friends, we must love each other because love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born from God and knows God. 8 The person who doesnt love doesnt know God, because God is love. 9 God has shown us his love by sending his only Son into the world so that we could have life through him. 10 This is love: not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the payment for our sins. 11 Dear friends, if this is the way God loved us, we must also love each other. 12 No one has ever seen God. If we love each other, God lives in us, and his love is perfected in us. 13 We know that we live in him and he lives in us because he has given us his Spirit. 14 We have seen and testify to the fact that the Father sent his Son as the Savior of the world. 15 God lives in those who declare that Jesus is the Son of God, and they live in God. 16 We have known and believed that God loves us. God is love. Those who live in Gods love live in God, and God lives in them. 17 Gods love has reached its goal in us. So we look ahead with confidence to the day of judgment. While we are in this world, we are exactly like him with regard to love. 18 No fear exists where his love is. Rather, perfect love gets rid of fear, because fear involves punishment. The person who lives in fear doesnt have perfect love. 19 We love because God loved us first. 20 Whoever says, I love God, but hates another believer is a liar. People who dont love other believers, whom they have seen, cant love God, whom they have not seen. 21 Christ has given us this commandment: The person who loves God must also love other believers. "
Good News Translation,GNT,1 John,4,The True Spirit and the False Spirit,"My dear friends, do not believe all who claim to have the Spirit, but test them to find out if the spirit they have comes from God. For many false prophets have gone out everywhere. 2 This is how you will be able to know whether it is God's Spirit: anyone who acknowledges that Jesus Christ came as a human being has the Spirit who comes from God. 3 But anyone who denies this about Jesus does not have the Spirit from God. The spirit that he has is from the Enemy of Christ; you heard that it would come, and now it is here in the world already. 4 But you belong to God, my children, and have defeated the false prophets, because the Spirit who is in you is more powerful than the spirit in those who belong to the world. 5 Those false prophets speak about matters of the world, and the world listens to them because they belong to the world. 6 But we belong to God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever does not belong to God does not listen to us. This, then, is how we can tell the difference between the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error. 7 Dear friends, let us love one another, because love comes from God. Whoever loves is a child of God and knows God. 8 Whoever does not love does not know God, for God is love. 9 And God showed his love for us by sending his only Son into the world, so that we might have life through him. 10 This is what love is: it is not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the means by which our sins are forgiven. 11 Dear friends, if this is how God loved us, then we should love one another. 12 No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in union with us, and his love is made perfect in us. 13 We are sure that we live in union with God and that he lives in union with us, because he has given us his Spirit. 14 And we have seen and tell others that the Father sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. 15 If we declare that Jesus is the Son of God, we live in union with God and God lives in union with us. 16 And we ourselves know and believe the love which God has for us. God is love, and those who live in love live in union with God and God lives in union with them. 17 Love is made perfect in us in order that we may have courage on the Judgment Day; and we will have it because our life in this world is the same as Christ's. 18 There is no fear in love; perfect love drives out all fear. So then, love has not been made perfect in anyone who is afraid, because fear has to do with punishment. 19 We love because God first loved us. 20 If we say we love God, but hate others, we are liars. For we cannot love God, whom we have not seen, if we do not love others, whom we have seen. 21 The command that Christ has given us is this: whoever loves God must love others also. "
International Childrens Bible,ICB,1 John,5,Faith in the Son of God,"Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is Gods child. The person who loves the Father also loves the Fathers children. 2 How do we know that we love Gods children? We know because we love God and we obey his commands. 3 Loving God means obeying his commands. And Gods commands are not too hard for us. 4 Everyone who is a child of God has the power to win against the world. It is our faith that wins the victory against the world. 5 So the one who conquers the world is the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God. 6 Jesus Christ is the One who came with water[a] and with blood.[b] He did not come by water only. He came by both water and blood. And the Spirit says that this is true. The Spirit is the truth. 7 So there are three witnesses:[c] 8 the Spirit, the water, and the blood. These three witnesses agree. 9 We believe people when they say something is true. But what God says is more important. And he has told us the truth about his own Son. 10 Anyone who believes in the Son of God has the truth that God told us. Anyone who does not believe makes God a liar. He does not believe what God told us about his Son. 11 This is what God told us: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12 Whoever has the Son has life. But the person who does not have the Son of God does not have life. 13 I write this letter to you who believe in the Son of God. I write so that you will know that you have eternal life now. 14 We can come to God with no doubts. This means that when we ask God for things (and those things agree with what God wants for us), then God cares about what we say. 15 God listens to us every time we ask him. So we know that he gives us the things that we ask from him. 16 Suppose someone sees his brother in Christ sinning (sin that does not lead to eternal death). That person should pray for his brother who is sinning. Then God will give the brother life. I am talking about people whose sin does not lead to eternal death. There is sin that leads to death. I do not mean that a person should pray about that sin. 17 Doing wrong is always sin. But there is sin that does not lead to eternal death. 18 We know that anyone who is Gods child does not continue to sin. The Son of God keeps him safe, and the Evil One cannot hurt him. 19 We know that we belong to God. But the Evil One controls the whole world. 20 And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding. Now we can know God, the One who is true. And our lives are in that true God and in his Son, Jesus Christ. He is the true God, and he is eternal life. 21 So, dear children, keep yourselves away from false gods. "
Holman Christian Standard Bible,HCSB,1 John,4,The Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Error,"Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to determine if they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 This is how you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit who confesses that Jesus Christ has[a] come in the flesh is from God.(C) 3 But every spirit who does not confess Jesus[b] is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist; you have heard that he is coming, and he is already in the world now. 4 You are from God, little children, and you have conquered them, because the One who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.(F) 5 They are from the world. Therefore what they say is from the world, and the world listens to them. 6 We are from God. Anyone who knows God listens to us; anyone who is not from God does not listen to us. From this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deception.(I) 7 Dear friends, let us love one another, because love is from God, and everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. 8 The one who does not love does not know God, because God is love. 9 Gods love was revealed among us in this way:[c] God sent His One and Only Son(L) into the world so that we might live(M) through Him. 10 Love consists in this: not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the[d] propitiation(O) for our sins. 11 Dear friends, if God loved us in this way, we also must love one another. 12 No one has ever seen God.[e] If we love one another, God remains in[f] us and His love is perfected in us. 13 This is how we know that we remain in Him and He in us: He has given assurance to us from His Spirit.(S) 14 And we have seen and we testify that the Father has sent His Son as the worlds Savior. 15 Whoever confesses[g] that Jesus is the Son of GodGod remains in him and he in God. 16 And we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and the one who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him. 17 In this, love is perfected with us so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment, for we are as He is in this world.(W) 18 There is no fear in love; instead, perfect love drives out fear, because fear involves punishment.[h] So the one who fears has not reached perfection in love.(Y) 19 We love[i] because He first loved us. 20 If anyone says, I love God, yet hates his brother, he is a liar.(AB) For the person who does not love his brother(AC) he has seen cannot love the God he has not seen.[j] 21 And we have this command from Him: The one who loves God must also love his brother. "
International Childrens Bible,ICB,1 John,1,God Forgives Our Sins,"We write you now about something that has always existed. We have heard. We have seen with our own eyes. We have watched, and we have touched with our hands. We write to you about the Word[a] that gives life. 2 He who gives life was shown to us. We saw him, and we can give proof about it. And now we tell you that he has life that continues forever. The one who gives this life was with God the Father. God showed him to us. 3 Now we tell you what we have seen and heard because we want you to have fellowship with us. The fellowship we share together is with God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ. 4 We write this to you so that we may be full of joy.[b] 5 Here is the message we have heard from God and now tell to you: God is light,[c] and in him there is no darkness at all. 6 So if we say that we have fellowship with God, but we continue living in darkness, then we are liars. We do not follow the truth. 7 God is in the light. We should live in the light, too. If we live in the light, we share fellowship with each other. And when we live in the light, the blood of the death of Jesus, Gods Son, is making us clean from every sin. 8 If we say that we have no sin, we are fooling ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 9 But if we confess our sins, he will forgive our sins. We can trust God. He does what is right. He will make us clean from all the wrongs we have done. 10 If we say that we have not sinned, then we make God a liar. We do not accept Gods true teaching. "
Good News Translation,GNT,1 John,1,The Word of Life,"We write to you about the Word of life, which has existed from the very beginning. We have heard it, and we have seen it with our eyes; yes, we have seen it, and our hands have touched it. 2 When this life became visible, we saw it; so we speak of it and tell you about the eternal life which was with the Father and was made known to us. 3 What we have seen and heard we announce to you also, so that you will join with us in the fellowship that we have with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. 4 We write this in order that our[a] joy may be complete. 5 Now the message that we have heard from his Son and announce is this: God is light, and there is no darkness at all in him. 6 If, then, we say that we have fellowship with him, yet at the same time live in the darkness, we are lying both in our words and in our actions. 7 But if we live in the lightjust as he is in the lightthen we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from every sin. 8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and there is no truth in us. 9 But if we confess our sins to God, he will keep his promise and do what is right: he will forgive us our sins and purify us from all our wrongdoing. 10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make a liar out of God, and his word is not in us. "
Holman Christian Standard Bible,HCSB,1 John,3,The Command to Love,"1 Look at how great a love[a] the Father has given us that we should be called Gods children. And we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it didnt know Him. 2 Dear friends, we are Gods children now, and what we will be has not yet been revealed. We know that when He appears, we will be like Him(B) because we will see Him as He is.(C) 3 And everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself just as He is pure.(E) 4 Everyone who commits sin also breaks the law;[b] sin is the breaking of law. 5 You know that He was revealed so that He might take away sins,[c] and there is no sin in Him.(G) 6 Everyone who remains in Him does not sin;[d](I) everyone who[e] sins has not seen Him or known Him. 7 Little children, let no one deceive you! The one who does what is right is righteous, just as He is righteous. 8 The one who commits[f] sin is of the Devil, for the Devil has sinned from the beginning. The Son of God was revealed(K) for this purpose: to destroy the Devils works. 9 Everyone who has been born of God does not sin,[g] because His[h] seed(M) remains in him; he is not able to sin,[i] because he has been born of God. 10 This is how Gods childrenand the Devils childrenare made evident. Whoever does not do what is right is not of God, especially the one who does not love his brother. 11 For this is the message you have heard from the beginning: We should love one another, 12 unlike Cain, who was of the evil one(P) and murdered[j] his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his works were evil, and his brothers were righteous. 13 Do not be surprised, brothers, if the world hates you. 14 We know that we have passed from death to life because we love our brothers. The one who does not love remains in death. 15 Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer,(T) and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in him. 16 This is how we have come to know love: He laid down His life for us.(V) We should also lay down our lives for our brothers.(W) 17 If anyone has this worlds goods and sees his brother in need(Y) but closes his eyes(Z) to his needhow can Gods love reside in him?(AA) 18 Little children, we must not love with word or speech, but with truth and action. 19 This is how we will know we belong to the truth and will convince our conscience in His presence, 20 even if our conscience condemns us, that God is greater than our conscience, and He knows all things. 21 Dear friends, if our conscience doesnt condemn us, we have confidence before God 22 and can receive whatever we ask from Him because we keep His commands and do what is pleasing in His sight. 23 Now this is His command: that we believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another as He commanded us. 24 The one who keeps His commands remains in Him, and He in him. And the way we know that He remains in us(AH) is from the Spirit(AI) He has given us. "
GODS WORD Translation,GW,1 John,5,Those Who Believe in Jesus Are Gods Children,"Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Messiah has been born from God. Everyone who loves the Father also loves his children. 2 We know that we love Gods children when we love God by obeying his commandments. 3 To love God means that we obey his commandments. Obeying his commandments isnt difficult 4 because everyone who has been born from God has won the victory over the world. Our faith is what wins the victory over the world. 5 Who wins the victory over the world? Isnt it the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? 6 This Son of God is Jesus Christ, who came by water and blood. He didnt come with water only, but with water and with blood. The Spirit is the one who verifies this, because the Spirit is the truth. 7 There are three witnesses:[a] 8 the Spirit, the water, and the blood. These three witnesses agree. 9 We accept human testimony. Gods testimony is greater because it is the testimony that he has given about his Son. 10 Those who believe in the Son of God have the testimony of God in them. Those who dont believe God have made God a liar. They havent believed the testimony that God has given about his Son. 11 This is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is found in his Son. 12 The person who has the Son has this life. The person who doesnt have the Son of God doesnt have this life. 13 Ive written this to those who believe in the Son of God so that they will know that they have eternal life. 14 We are confident that God listens to us if we ask for anything that has his approval. 15 We know that he listens to our requests. So we know that we already have what we ask him for. 16 If you see another believer committing a sin that doesnt lead to death, you should pray that God would give that person life. This is true for those who commit sins that dont lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. Im not telling you to pray about that. 17 Every kind of wrongdoing is sin, yet there are sins that dont lead to death. 18 We know that those who have been born from God dont go on sinning. Rather, the Son of God protects them, and the evil one cant harm them. 19 We know that we are from God, and that the whole world is under the control of the evil one. 20 We know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding so that we know the real God. We are in the one who is real, his Son Jesus Christ. This Jesus Christ is the real God and eternal life. 21 Dear children, guard yourselves from false gods. "
International Childrens Bible,ICB,1 John,3,We Are Gods Children,"The Father has loved us so much! He loved us so much that we are called children of God. And we really are his children. But the people in the world do not understand that we are Gods children, because they have not known him. 2 Dear friends, now we are children of God. We have not yet been shown what we will be in the future. But we know that when Christ comes again, we will be like him. We will see him as he really is. 3 Christ is pure. And every person who has this hope in Christ keeps himself pure like Christ. 4 When a person sins, he breaks Gods law. Yes, sinning is the same as living against Gods law. 5 You know that Christ came to take away sins. There is no sin in Christ. 6 So the person who lives in Christ does not go on sinning. If he goes on sinning, he has never really understood Christ and has never known him. 7 Dear children, do not let any person lead you the wrong way. Christ is righteous. To be like Christ, a person must do what is right. 8 The devil has been sinning since the beginning. Anyone who continues to sin belongs to the devil. The Son of God came for this purpose: to destroy the devils work. 9 When God makes someone his child, that person does not go on sinning. The new life God gave that person stays in him. So he is not able to go on sinning, because he has become a child of God. 10 So we can see who Gods children are and who the devils children are. Those who do not do what is right are not children of God. And anyone who does not love his brother is not a child of God. 11 This is the teaching you have heard from the beginning: We must love each other. 12 Do not be like Cain who belonged to the Evil One. Cain killed his brother. He killed his brother because the things Cain did were evil, and the things his brother did were good. 13 Brothers, do not be surprised when the people of this world hate you. 14 We know that we have left death and have come into life. We know this because we love our brothers in Christ. Whoever does not love is still in death. 15 Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer.[a] And you know that no murderer has eternal life in him. 16 This is how we know what real love is: Jesus gave his life for us. So we should give our lives for our brothers. 17 Suppose a believer is rich enough to have all that he needs. He sees his brother in Christ who is poor and does not have what he needs. What if the believer does not help the poor brother? Then the believer does not have Gods love in his heart. 18 My children, our love should not be only words and talk. Our love must be true love. And we should show that love by what we do. 19-20 This is the way we know that we belong to the way of truth. When our hearts make us feel guilty, we can still have peace before God. God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything. 21 My dear friends, if we do not feel that we are doing wrong, we can be without fear when we come to God. 22 And God gives us the things we ask for. We receive these things because we obey Gods commands, and we do what pleases him. 23 This is what God commands: that we believe in his Son, Jesus Christ, and that we love each other, just as he commanded. 24 The person who obeys Gods commands lives in God. And God lives in him. How do we know that God lives in us? We know because of the Spirit whom God gave us. "
International Standard Version,ISV,1 John,1,"Jesus, the Word of Life","What existed from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we observed and touched with our own handsthis is the[a] Word of life! 2 This life was revealed to us, and we have seen it and testify about it. We declare to you this eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us. 3 What we have seen and heard we declare to you so that you, too, can have fellowship with us. Now this fellowship of ours is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus, the Messiah.[b] 4 We are writing these things[c] so that our[d] joy may be full. 5 This is the message that we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light, and in him there is no darknessnone at all! 6 If we claim that we have fellowship with him but keep living in darkness, we are lying and not practicing the truth. 7 But if we keep living in the light as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. 8 If we say that we do not have any sin, we are deceiving ourselves and were not being truthful to ourselves. 9 If we make it our habit to confess our sins, in his faithful righteousness he forgives us for those sins and cleanses us from all unrighteousness. 10 If we say that we have never sinned, we make him a liar and his word has no place in us. "
International Standard Version,ISV,1 John,5,Faith Overcomes the World,"Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Messiah[a] has been born from God, and everyone who loves the parent also loves the child. 2 This is how we know that we love Gods children: we love God and keep his commandments. 3 For this demonstrates our love for God: We keep his commandments, and his commandments are not difficult, 4 because everyone who is born from God has overcome the world. Our faith is the victory that overcomes the world. 5 Who overcomes the world? Is it not the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? 6 This man, Jesus the Messiah,[b] is the one who came by water and bloodnot with water only, but with water and with blood. The Spirit is the one who verifies this, because the Spirit is the truth. 7 For there are three witnesses in heaventhe Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these three are one.[c] 8 And there are three witness on earththe Spirit, the water, and the bloodand these three are one. 9 If we accept human testimony, Gods testimony is greater, because it is the testimony of God and because he has testified about his Son. 10 The person who believes in the Son of God believes this testimony personally.[d] The person who does not believe God[e] has made him a liar by not believing the testimony that he[f] has given about his Son. 11 This is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is found in his Son. 12 The person who has the Son has this life. The person who does not have the Son of God does not have this life. 13 I have written these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life. 14 And this is the confidence that we have in him: if we ask for anything according to his will, he listens to us. 15 And if we know that he listens to our requests, we can be sure that we have what we ask him for. 16 If anyone sees his brother committing a sin that does not lead to death, he should pray that God[g] would give him life. This applies to those who commit sins that do not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I am not telling you to pray about that. 17 Every kind of wrongdoing is sin, yet there are sins that do not lead to death. 18 We know that the person who has been born from God does not go on sinning. Rather, the Son[h] of God protects them, and the evil one cannot harm them. 19 We know that we are from God and that the whole world lies under the control of the evil one. 20 We also know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding so that we may know the true God.[i] We are in union with the one who is true, his Son Jesus the Messiah,[j] who is the true God and eternal life. 21 Little children, keep yourselves away from idols.[k] "
Holman Christian Standard Bible,HCSB,1 John,5,The Certainty of Gods Testimony,"Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Messiah has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father also loves the one born of Him. 2 This is how we know that we love Gods children when we love God and obey[a] His commands. 3 For this is what love for God is: to keep His commands. Now His commands are not a burden, 4 because whatever has been born of God conquers the world. This is the victory that has conquered the world: our faith. 5 And who is the one who conquers the world but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?(D) 6 Jesus ChristHe is the One who came by water and blood, not by water only, but by water and by blood.(F) And the Spirit is the One who testifies,(G) because the Spirit is the truth. 7 For there are three that testify:[b] 8 the Spirit, the water, and the blood(J)and these three are in agreement. 9 If we accept the testimony of men, Gods testimony is greater, because it is Gods testimony that He has given about His Son. 10 (The one who believes in the Son of God has this testimony within him. The one who does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony God has given about His Son.) 11 And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. 12 The one who has the Son has life. The one who doesnt have the Son of God does not have life. 13 I have written these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life. 14 Now this is the confidence we have before Him: Whenever we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.(P) 15 And if we know that He hears whatever we ask, we know that we have what we have asked Him for.(R) 16 If anyone sees his brother committing a sin that does not bring death, he should ask, and God[c] will give life to himto those who commit sin that doesnt bring death. There is sin[d] that brings death. I am not saying he should pray about that. 17 All unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin that does not bring death. 18 We know that everyone who has been born of God does not sin, but the One[e] who is born of God keeps him,[f][g] and the evil one does not touch him. 19 We know that we are of God, and the whole world is under the sway of the evil one. 20 And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding so that we may know the true One.[h] We are in the true Onethat is, in His Son Jesus Christ.(U) He is the true God and eternal life. 21 Little children, guard yourselves from idols. "
International Childrens Bible,ICB,1 John,2,Jesus Is Our Helper,"My dear children, I write this letter to you so that you will not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have Jesus Christ to help us. He is the Righteous One. He defends us before God the Father. 2 Jesus died in our place to take away our sins. And Jesus is the way that all people can have their sins taken away, too. 3 If we obey what God has told us to do, then we are sure that we truly know God. 4 If someone says, I know God! but does not obey Gods commands, then he is a liar. The truth is not in him. 5 But if someone obeys Gods teaching, then Gods love has truly arrived at its goal in him. This is how we know that we are following God: 6 Whoever says that God lives in him must live as Jesus lived. 7 My dear friends, I am not writing a new command to you. It is the same command you have had since the beginning. It is the teaching you have already heard. 8 But I am writing a new command to you. This command is true; you can see its truth in Jesus and in yourselves. The darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining. 9 Someone says, I am in the light.[a] But if he hates his brother, he is still in the darkness. 10 Whoever loves his brother lives in the light, and there is nothing in him that will cause him to do wrong. 11 But whoever hates his brother is in darkness. He lives in darkness and does not know where he is going. The darkness has made him blind. 12 I write to you, dear children, because your sins are forgiven through Christ. 13 I write to you, fathers, because you know the One who existed from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have defeated the Evil One. 14 I write to you, children, because you know the Father. I write to you, fathers, because you know the One who existed from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong; the word of God lives in you, and you have defeated the Evil One. 15 Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 These are the evil things in the world: wanting things to please our sinful selves, wanting the sinful things we see, being too proud of the things we have. But none of those things comes from the Father. All of them come from the world. 17 The world is passing away. And everything that people want in the world is passing away. But the person who does what God wants lives forever. 18 My dear children, the end is near! You have heard that the Enemy of Christ is coming. And now many enemies of Christ are already here. So we know that the end is near. 19 Those enemies of Christ were in our group. But they left us. They did not really belong with us. If they were really part of our group, then they would have stayed with us. But they left. This shows that none of them really belonged with us. 20 You have the gift[b] that the Holy One gave you. So you all know the truth.[c] 21 Why do I write to you? Do I write because you do not know the truth? No, I write this letter because you do know the truth. And you know that no lie comes from the truth. 22 So who is the liar? It is the person who says Jesus is not the Christ. A person who says Jesus is not the Christ is the enemy of Christ. He does not believe in the Father or in his Son. 23 If anyone does not believe in the Son, he does not have the Father. But whoever accepts the Son has the Father, too. 24 Be sure that you continue to follow the teaching that you heard from the beginning. If you continue in that teaching, you will stay in the Son and in the Father. 25 And this is what the Son promised to uslife forever. 26 I am writing this letter about those people who are trying to lead you the wrong way. 27 Christ gave you a special gift. You still have this gift in you. So you do not need any other teacher. The gift he gave you teaches you about everything. This gift is true, not false. So continue to live in Christ, as his gift taught you. 28 Yes, my dear children, live in him. If we do this, we can be without fear on the day when Christ comes back. We will not need to hide and be ashamed when he comes. 29 You know that Christ is righteous. So you know that all who do what is right are Gods children. "
International Standard Version,ISV,1 John,3,We are Gods Children,"See what kind of love the Father has given us: We are called Gods childrenand that is what we are![a] For this reason the world does not recognize us, because it did not recognize him, either. 2 Dear friends, we are now Gods children, but what we will be like has not been revealed yet. We know that when the Messiah[b] is revealed, we will be like him, because we will see him as he is. 3 And everyone who has this hope based on him keeps himself pure, just as the Messiah[c] is pure. 4 Everyone who keeps living in sin also practices disobedience. In fact, sin is disobedience. 5 You know that the Messiah[d] was revealed to take away sins,[e] and there is not any sin in him. 6 No one who remains in union with him keeps on sinning. The one who keeps on sinning hasnt seen him or known him. 7 Little children, dont let anyone deceive you. The person who practices righteousness is righteous, just as the Messiah[f] is righteous. 8 The person who practices sin belongs to the evil one, because the Devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason that the Son of God was revealed was to destroy what the Devil has been doing. 9 No one who has been born from God practices sin, because Gods[g] seed abides in him. Indeed, he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born from God. 10 This is how Gods children and the Devils children are distinguished.[h] No person who fails to practice righteousness and to love his brother is from God. 11 This is the message that you have heard from the beginning: We should love one another. 12 Do not be like Cain,[i] who was from the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because what he was doing was evil and his brothers actions[j] were righteous. 13 So do not be surprised, brothers, if the world hates you. 14 We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love one another. The person who does not love[k] remains spiritually[l] dead. 15 Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life present in him. 16 This is how we have come to know love: the Messiah[m] gave his life for us. We, too, ought to give our lives for our brothers. 17 Whoever has earthly possessions and notices a brother in need and yet withholds his compassion from him, how can the love of God be present in him? 18 Little children, we must stop expressing love merely by our words and manner of speech; we must love[n] also in action[o] and in truth. 19 This is how we will know that we belong to the truth and how we will be able to keep ourselves[p] strong in his presence. 20 If our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts and knows everything. 21 Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence in the presence of God. 22 Whatever we request we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him. 23 And this is his commandment: to believe in the name of his Son, Jesus the Messiah,[q] and to love one another as he commanded us. 24 The person who keeps his commandments abides in God,[r] and God abides in him.[s] This is how we can be sure that he remains in us: he has given us his Spirit. "
International Childrens Bible,ICB,1 John,4,Warning Against False Teachers,"My dear friends, many false prophets are in the world now. So do not believe every spirit. But test the spirits to see if they are from God. 2 This is how you can know Gods Spirit: One spirit says, I believe that Jesus is the Christ who came to earth and became a man. That Spirit is from God. 3 Another spirit refuses to say this about Jesus. That spirit is not from God but is the spirit of the Enemy of Christ. You have heard that the Enemy of Christ is coming. And now he is already in the world. 4 My dear children, you belong to God. So you have defeated them because Gods Spirit, who is in you, is greater than the devil, who is in the world. 5 And they belong to the world. What they say is from the world, and the world listens to them. 6 But we are from God, and those who know God listen to us. But those who are not from God do not listen to us. That is how we know the Spirit that is true and the spirit that is false. 7 Dear friends, we should love each other, because love comes from God. The person who loves has become Gods child and knows God. 8 Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. 9 This is how God showed his love to us: He sent his only Son into the world to give us life through him. 10 True love is Gods love for us, not our love for God. God sent his Son to die in our place to take away our sins. 11 That is how much God loved us, dear friends! So we also must love each other. 12 No one has ever seen God. But if we love each other, God lives in us. If we love each other, Gods love has reached its goal. It is made perfect in us. 13 We know that we live in God and God lives in us. We know this because God gave us his Spirit. 14 We have seen that the Father sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. That is what we teach. 15 If someone says, I believe that Jesus is the Son of God, then God lives in him. And he lives in God. 16 And so we know the love that God has for us, and we trust that love. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God lives in him. 17 If Gods love is made perfect in us, then we can be without fear on the day God judges us. We will be without fear, because in this world we are like him. 18 Where Gods love is, there is no fear, because Gods perfect love takes away fear. It is punishment that makes a person fear. So love is not made perfect in the person who has fear. 19 We love because God first loved us. 20 If someone says, I love God, but hates his brother, he is a liar. He can see his brother, but he hates him. So he cannot love God, whom he has never seen. 21 And God gave us this command: Whoever loves God must also love his brother. "
J.B. Phillips New Testament,PHILLIPS,1 John,1,Experience of living in the light,"1-4 We are writing to you about something which has always existed yet which we ourselves actually saw and heard: something which we had an opportunity to observe closely and even to hold in our hands, and yet, as we know now, was something of the very Word of life himself! For it was life which appeared before us: we saw it, we are eye-witnesses of it, and are now writing to you about it. It was the very life of all ages, the life that has always existed with the Father, which actually became visible in person to us mortal men. We repeat, we really saw and heard what we are now writing to you about. We want you to be with us in thisin this fellowship with the Father, and Jesus Christ his Son. We must write and tell you about it, because the more that fellowship extends the greater the joy it brings to us who are already in it. 5-10 Here, then, is the message which we heard from him, and now proclaim to you: GOD IS LIGHT and no shadow of darkness can exist in him. Consequently, if we were to say that we enjoyed fellowship with him and still went on living in darkness, we should be both telling and living a lie. But if we really are living in the same light in which he eternally exists, then we have true fellowship with each other, and the blood which his Son shed for us keeps us clean from all sin. If we refuse to admit that we are sinners, then we live in a world of illusion and truth becomes a stranger to us. But if we freely admit that we have sinned, we find God utterly reliable and straightforwardhe forgives our sins and makes us thoroughly clean from all that is evil. For if we take up the attitude we have not sinned, we flatly deny Gods diagnosis of our condition and cut ourselves off from what he has to say to us. "
J.B. Phillips New Testament,PHILLIPS,1 John,2,Love and obedience are essentials for living in the light,"1-2 I write these things to you (may I call you my childrenfor thats how I think of you), to help you to avoid sin. But if a man should sin, remember that our advocate before the Father is Jesus Christ the righteous, the one who made personal atonement for our sins (and for those of the rest of the world as well). 3-6 It is only when we obey Gods laws that we can be quite sure that we really know him. The man who claims to know God but does not obey his laws is not only a liar but lives in self-delusion. In practice, the more a man learns to obey Gods laws the more truly and fully does he express his love for him. Obedience is the test of whether we really live in God or not. The life of a man who professes to be living in God must bear the stamp of Christ. 7-11 I am not really writing to tell you of any new command, brothers of mine. It is the old, original command which you had at the beginning; it is the old message which you have heard before. And yet as I give it to you again I know that it is truein your life as it was in his. For the darkness is beginning to lift and the true light is now shining in the world. Anyone who claims to be in the light and hates his brother is, in fact, still in complete darkness. The man who loves his brother lives and moves in the light, and has no reason to stumble. But the man who hates his brother is shut off from the light and gropes his way in the dark without seeing where he is going. To move in the dark is to move blindfold. 12-14 I write this letter to you all, as my dear children, because your sins are forgiven for his names sake. I write to you who are now fathers, because you have known him who has always existed. And to you vigorous young men I am writing because you have been strong in defeating the evil one. Yes, I have written these lines to you all, dear children, because you know the Father; to you fathers because of your experience of the one who has always existed, and to you young men because you have all the vigour of youth, because you have a hold on Gods truth and because you have defeated the evil one. 15-17 Never give your hearts to this world or to any of the things in it. A man cannot love the Father and love the world at the same time. For the whole world-system, based as it is on mens primitive desires, their greedy ambitions and the glamour of all that they think splendid, is not derived from the Father at all, but from the world itself. The world and all its passionate desires will one day disappear. But the man who is following Gods will is part of the permanent and cannot die. 18-19 Even now, dear children, we are getting near the end of things. You have heard, I expect, the prophecy about the coming of the anti-Christ. Believe me, there are anti-christs about already, which confirms my belief that we are near the end. These men went out from our company, it is true, but they never really belonged to it. If they had really belonged to us they would have stayed. In fact, their going proves beyond doubt that men like that were not our men at all. 20-23 God has given you all a certain amount of spiritual insight, and indeed I have not written this warning as if I were writing to men who dont know what error is. I write because your eyes are clear enough to discern a lie when you come across it. And what, I ask you, is the crowning lie? Surely the denial that Jesus is Gods anointed one, his Christ. I say, therefore, that any man who refuses to acknowledge the Father and the Son is an anti-christ. The man who will not recognise the Son cannot possibly know the Father; yet the man who believes in the Son will find that he knows the Father as well. 24-25 For yourselves I beg you to stick to the original teaching. If you do, you will be living in fellowship with both the Father and the Son. And that means sharing his own life for ever, as he has promised. 26-28 It is true that I felt I had to write the above about men who would dearly love to lead you astray. Yet I know that the touch of his Spirit never leaves you, and you dont really need a human teacher. You know that his Spirit teaches you about all things, always telling you the truth and never telling you a lie. So, as he has taught you, live continually in him. Yes, now, little children remember to live continually in him. So that if he were suddenly to reveal himself we should still know exactly where we stand, and should not have to shrink away from his presence. 29 You all know that God is really good. You may be just as sure that the man who leads a really good life is a true child of God. "
Jubilee Bible 2000,JUB,1 John,4,," Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world. 2 In this know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in flesh is of God: 3 And every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ is come in flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, of which ye have heard that it should come, and that now it is already in the world. 4  Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. 5 They are of the world; therefore, they speak of the world, and the world hears them. 6 We are of God; he that knows God hears us; he that is not of God does not hear us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error. 7  Beloved, let us love one another, for charity is of God. Anyone that loves is born of God and knows God. 8 He that does not love does not know God, for God is charity. 9 In this was the charity of God demonstrated in us, in that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. 10 In this does the charity consist, not because we had loved God, but because he loved us and has sent his Son to be the reconciliation for our sins. 11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. 12 No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abides in us, and his charity is completed in us. 13 In this we know that we abide in him, and he in us, in that he has given us of his Spirit. 14  And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world. 15 Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. 16 And we have known and believed the charity that God has in us. God is charity, and he that abides in charity abides in God, and God in him. 17  In this the charity with us is made perfect, that we may have confidence in the day of judgment, that as he is, so are we in this world. 18 In charity there is no fear; but charity that is perfect casts out fear; because fear has torment; from which he that fears is not complete in charity. 19 We love him, because he first loved us. 20 If anyone says, I love God and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he that does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen? 21 And we have this commandment from him, That he who loves God loves his brother also. "
Jubilee Bible 2000,JUB,1 John,1,," That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life 2 (for the life is manifested, and we also saw it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father and appeared unto us); 3 that which we have seen and heard we declare unto you, that ye also may have communion with us; and truly our communion is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. 4 And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be fulfilled. 5  This then is the promise which we have heard of him and declare unto you, That God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. 6 If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth; 7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have communion with him in the midst of us, and the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son cleanses us from all sin. 8  If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and there is no truth in us. 9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. "
Jubilee Bible 2000,JUB,1 John,3,," Behold, what charity the Father has given us, that we should be called the sons of God; therefore the world does not know us, because it does not know him. 2 Beloved, now we are the sons of God, and it is not yet made manifest what we shall be; but we know that if he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. 3 And every one that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as he is pure. 4  Whosoever commits sin transgresses also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law. 5 And ye know that he appeared to take away our sins, and there is no sin in him. 6 Whosoever abides in him does not sin: whosoever sins has not seen him or known him. 7 Little children, let no one deceive you; he that does righteousness is righteous, even as he also is righteous. 8 He that commits sin is of the devil; for the devil sins from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God appeared, that he might undo the works of the devil. 9 Whosoever is born of God does not commit sin; for his seed remains in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. 10 In this the sons of God are manifest, and the sons of the devil: whosoever does not righteousness and that loves not his brother is not of God. 11  For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, That we should love one another. 12 Not as Cain, who was of the wicked one and killed his brother. And why did he kill him? Because his own works were evil, and his brothers righteous. 13 Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hates you. 14  We know that we are passed from death unto life, in that we love the brethren. He that does not love his brother abides in death. 15 Whosoever hates his brother is a murderer and ye know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. 16 In this we have known the charity of God because he laid down his life for us; we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. 17 But whosoever has this worlds goods and sees his brother have need and shuts up his bowels of compassion from him, how does the charity of God abide in him? 18 My little children, let us not love in word neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth. 19 And in this we know that we are of the truth and have our hearts certified before him. 20  And if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart and knows all things. 21 Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, then we have confidence in God; 22 and whatsoever we ask, we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. 23  And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he has commanded us. 24 And he that keeps his commandments dwells in him, and he in him. And in this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit which he has given us. "
Jubilee Bible 2000,JUB,1 John,2,," My little children, I write these things unto you, that ye sin not; and if anyone has sinned, we have an Advocate before the Father, Jesus, the righteous Christ; 2 and he is the reconciliation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world. 3  And in this we do know that we have known him if we keep his commandments. 4 He that says, I have known him, and does not keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 5 But whosoever keeps his word, in him verily is the charity of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him. 6 He that says he abides in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked. 7  Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning. 8 Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which is the truth in him and in you, because the darkness is past, and the true light now shines. 9 He that says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in darkness. 10 He that loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him. 11 But he that hates his brother is in darkness and walks in darkness and does not know where he goes, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes. 12  I write unto you, little children, that your sins are forgiven you for his names sake. 13 I write unto you, fathers, that ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, that ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, that ye have known the Father. 14 I have written unto you, fathers, that ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, that ye are strong and the word of God abides in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one. 15 Love not the world neither the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the charity of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. 17 And the world passes away and the lust thereof, but he that does the will of God abides for ever. 18  Little children, it is the last hour, and as ye have heard that the antichrist comes, likewise there are also beginning to be many antichrists, by which we know that it is the last time. 19 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us; but this happened that it might be made manifest that they were not all of us. 20  But ye have the anointing of the Holy One, and ye know all things. 21 I have not written unto you as if ye ignore the truth, but as unto those that know it, and that no lie is of the truth. 22 Who is a liar but he that denies that Jesus is the Christ? This same is antichrist, who denies the Father and the Son. 23 Whosoever denies the Son, the same does not have the Father. Whosoever confesses the Son, has the Father also. 24 Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. For if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall abide in you, ye also shall continue to abide in the Son and in the Father. 25 And this is the promise that he has promised us, even eternal life. 26 These things I have written unto you concerning those that seduce you. 27 But the anointing which ye have received of him abides in you, and ye do not need that anyone teach you; but as the same anointing teaches you of all things and is truth, and is no lie; and even as it has taught you, abide ye in him. 28  And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming. 29 If ye know that he is righteous, also know that any one that does righteousness is born of him. "
International Standard Version,ISV,1 John,4,Test What People Say,"Dear friends, stop believing[a] every spirit. Instead, test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 This is how you can recognize Gods Spirit: Every spirit who acknowledges that Jesus the Messiah[b] has become humanand remains sois from God. 3 But every spirit who does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist. You have heard that he is coming, and now he is already in the world. 4 Little children, you belong to God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. 5 These people belong to the world. That is why they speak from the worlds perspective,[c] and the world listens to them. 6 We belong to God. The person who knows God listens to us. Whoever does not belong to God does not listen to us. This is how we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deceit. 7 Dear friends, let us continuously love one another, because love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born from God and knows God. 8 The person who does not love does not know God, because God is love. 9 This is how Gods love was revealed among us: God sent his uniquely existing Son into the world so that we might live through him. 10 This is love: not that we have loved[d] God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins. 11 Dear friends, if this is the way God loved us, we must also love one another. 12 No one has ever seen God. If we love one another, God lives in us, and his love is perfected in us. 13 This is how we know that we abide in him and he in us: he has given us his Spirit. 14 We have seen for ourselves and can testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. 15 God abides in the one who acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, and he abides in God. 16 We have come to know and rely on[e] the love that God has for us. God is love, and the person who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. 17 This is how love has been perfected among us: we will have confidence on the day of judgment because, during our time in this world, we are just like him. 18 There is no fear where love exists.[f] Rather, perfect love banishes fear, for fear involves punishment, and the person who lives in fear has not been perfected in love. 19 We love[g] because God[h] first loved us. 20 Whoever says, I love God, but hates his brother is a liar. The one who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love the God whom he has not seen. 21 And this is the commandment that we have from him: the person who loves God must also love his brother. "
Jubilee Bible 2000,JUB,1 John,5,," Whosoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God; and anyone that loves him that begat also loves him that is born of him. 2 In this we know that we love the sons of God, when we love God and keep his commandments. 3 For this is the charity of God, that we keep his commandments, and his commandments are not grievous. 4 For whatsoever is born of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory that overcomes the world, even our faith. 5 Who is he that overcomes the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God? 6  This is Jesus, the Christ, who came by water and blood; not by water only, but by water and blood. And the Spirit is he that bears witness, because the Spirit is the truth. 7 For there are three that bear witness in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one. 8 And there are three that bear witness on earth, the Spirit and the water and the blood; and these three agree in one. 9 If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he has testified of his Son. 10  He that believes in the Son of God has the witness of God in himself; he that does not believe God has made God a liar; because he does not believe the witness that God has testified of his Son. 11 And this is the witness, that God has given eternal life to us, and this life is in his Son. 12 He that has the Son has life; and he that does not have the Son of God does not have life. 13 These things I have written unto you that believe in the name of the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal life and that ye may believe in the name of the Son of God. 14  And this is the confidence that we have in God, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he hears us: 15 And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we also know that we have the petitions that we asked of him. 16 If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask God, and he shall give him life that is, unto those that do not sin unto death. There is sin unto death, for which I do not say that you should pray. 17 All unrighteousness is sin, but there is a sin not unto death. 18  We know that whoever is born of God does not sin; but he that is begotten of God keeps himself, and the wicked one does not touch him. 19 And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in wickedness. 20 But we know that the Son of God is come and has given us understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. 21 Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen. "
J.B. Phillips New Testament,PHILLIPS,1 John,4,I repeat my warning against false teaching,"1-3 Dont trust every spirit, dear friends of mine, but test them to discover whether they come from God or not. For the world is full of false prophets. You can test them in this simple way: every spirit that acknowledges the fact that Jesus Christ actually became man, comes from God, but the spirit which denies this fact does not come from God. The latter comes from the anti-christ, which you were warned would come and which is already in the world. 4-6 You, my children, who belong to God have already defeated this spirit, because the one who lives in you is far stronger than the anti-Christ in the world. The agents of the anti-christ are children of the world, they speak the worlds language and the world, of course, pays attention to what they say. We are Gods children and only the man who knows God hears our message; what we say means nothing to the man who is not himself a child of God. This gives us a ready means of distinguishing the true from the false. 7-8 To you whom I love I say, let us go on loving one another, for love comes from God. Every man who truly loves is Gods son and has some knowledge of him. But the man who does not love cannot know him at all, for God is love. 9-10 To us, the greatest demonstration of Gods love for us has been his sending his only Son into the world to give us life through him. We see real love, not in that fact that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to make personal atonement for our sins. 11 If God loved us as much as that, surely we, in our turn, should love each other! 12-13 It is true that no human being has ever had a direct vision of God. Yet if we love each other God does actually live within us, and his love grows in us towards perfection. And, as I wrote above, the guarantee of our living in him and his living in us is the share of his own Spirit which he gives us. 14-16a We ourselves are eye-witnesses able and willing to testify to the fact that the Father did send the Son to save the world. Everyone who acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God lives in him, and he lives in God. So we have come to know and trust the love God has for us. 16b-18 God is love, and the man whose life is lived in love does, in fact, live in God, and God does, in fact, live in him. So our love for him grows more and more, filling us with complete confidence for the day when he shall judge all menfor we realise that our life in this world is actually his life lived in us. Love contains no fearindeed fully-developed love expels every particle of fear, for fear always contains some of the torture of feeling guilty. This means that the man who lives in fear has not yet had his love perfected. 19-21 Yes, we love him because he first loved us. If a man says, I love God and hates his brother, he is a liar. For if he does not love the brother before his eyes how can he love the one beyond his sight? And in any case it is his explicit command that the one who loves God must love his brother too. "
J.B. Phillips New Testament,PHILLIPS,1 John,3,Conduct will show who is a mans spiritual father,"Consider the incredible love that the Father has shown us in allowing us to be called children of Godand that is not just what we are called, but what we are. Our heredity on the Godward side is no mere figure of speechwhich explains why the world will no more recognise us than it recognised Christ. 2 Oh, dear children of mine (forgive the affection of an old man!), have you realised it? Here and now we are Gods children. We dont know what we shall become in the future. We only know that, if reality were to break through, we should reflect his likeness, for we should see him as he really is! 3 Everyone who has at heart a hope like that keeps himself pure, for he knows how pure Christ is. 4-6 Everyone who commits sin breaks Gods law, for that is what sin is, by definitiona breaking of Gods law. You know, moreover, that Christ became man for the purpose of removing sin, and he himself was quite free from sin. The man who lives in Christ does not habitually sin. The regular sinner has never seen or known him. 7-9 You, my children, are younger than I am, and I dont want you to be taken in by any clever talk just here. The man who lives a consistently good life is a good man, as surely as God is good. But the man whose life is habitually sinful is spiritually a son of the devil, for the devil is behind all sin, as he always has been. Now the Son of God came to earth with the express purpose of liquidating the devils activities. The man who is really Gods son does not practise sin, for Gods nature is in him, for good, and such a heredity is incapable of sin. 10 Here we have a clear indication as to who are the children of God and who are the children of the devil. The man who does not lead a good life is no son of God, nor is the man who fails to love his brother. 11-13 For the original command, as you know, is that we should love one another. We are none of us to have the spirit of Cain, who was a son of the devil and murdered his brother. Have you realised his motive? It was just because he realised the goodness of his brothers life and the rottenness of his own. Dont be surprised, therefore, if the world hates you. 14-15 We know that we have crossed the frontier from death to life because we do love our brothers. The man without love for his brothers is living in death already. The man who actively hates his brother is a potential murderer, and you will readily see that the eternal life of God cannot live in the heart of a murderer. 16-18 We know and, to some extent realise, the love of God for us because Christ expressed it in laying down his life for us. We must in turn express our love by laying down our lives for those who are our brothers. But as for the well-to-do man who sees his brothers in want but shuts his eyesand his hearthow could anyone believe that the love of God lives in him? My children, let us not love merely in theory or in wordslet us love in sincerity and in practice! 19-20 If we live like this, we shall know that we are children of the truth and can reassure ourselves in the sight of God, even if our own hearts make us feel guilty. For God is infinitely greater than our hearts, and he knows everything. 21-23 And if, dear friends of mine, when we realise this our hearts no longer accuse us, we may have the utmost confidence in Gods presence. We receive whatever we ask for, because we are obeying his orders and following his plans. His orders are that we should put our trust in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one anotheras we used to hear him say in person. 24 The man who does obey Gods commands lives in God and God lives in him, and the guarantee of his presence within us is the Spirit he has given us. "
J.B. Phillips New Testament,PHILLIPS,1 John,5,"Only real faith in Christ as Gods son can make a man confident, obedient and loving","Everyone who really believes that Jesus is the Christ proves himself one of Gods family. The man who loves the Father cannot help loving the Fathers own Son. 2-5 The test of the genuineness of our love for Gods family lies in this questiondo we love God himself and do we obey his commands? For loving God means obeying his commands, and these commands of his are not burdensome, for Gods heredity within us will always conquer the world outside us. In fact, this faith of ours is the only way in which the world has been conquered. For who could ever be said to conquer the world, in the true sense, except the man who really believes that Jesus is Gods Son? 6-12 Jesus Christ himself is the one who came by water and by bloodnot by the water only, but by the water and the blood. The Spirit bears witness to this, for the Spirit is the truth. The witness therefore is a triple onethe Spirit in our own hearts, the signs of the water of baptism and the blood of atonementand they all say the same thing. If we are prepared to accept human testimony, Gods own testimony concerning his own Son is surely infinitely more valuable. The man who really believes in the Son of God will find Gods testimony in his own heart. The man who will not believe God is making him out to be a liar, because he is deliberately refusing to accept the testimony that God has given concerning his own Son. This is, that God has given men eternal life and this real life is to be found only in his Son. It follows naturally that any man who has genuine contact with Christ has this life; and if he has not, then he does not possess this life at all. 13 I have written like this to you who already believe in the name of Gods Son so that you may be quite sure that, here and now, you possess eternal life. 14-15 We have such confidence in him that we are certain that he hears every request that is made in accord with his own plan. And since we know that he invariably gives his attention to our prayers, whatever they are about, we can be quite sure that our prayers will be answered. 16-17 If any of you should see his brother committing a sin (I dont mean deliberately turning his back on God and embracing evil), he should pray to God for him and secure fresh life for the sinner. It is possible to commit sin that is a deliberate embracing of evil and that leads to spiritual deaththat is not the sort of sin I have in mind when I recommend prayer for the sinner. Every failure to obey Gods laws is sin, of course, but there is sin that does not preclude repentance and forgiveness. 18 We know that the true child of God does not sin, he is in the charge of Gods own Son and the evil one must keep his distance. 19-20 We know that we ourselves are children of God, and we also know that the world around us is under the power of the evil one. We know too that the Son of God has actually come to this world, and has shown us the way to know the one who is true. We know that our real life is in the true one, and in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the real God and this is real, eternal life. 21 But be on your guard, my dear children, against every false god! JOHN "
International Standard Version,ISV,1 John,2,The Messiah is Our Advocate,"My little children, Im writing these things to you so that you might not sin. Yet if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the FatherJesus, the Messiah,[a] one who is righteous. 2 It is he who is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole worlds. 3 This is how we can be sure that we have come to know him: if we continually keep his commandments. 4 The person who says, I have come to know him, but does not continually keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth has no place in that person. 5 But whoever continually keeps his commandments is the kind of person in whom Gods love has truly been perfected. This is how we can be sure that we are in union with God:[b] 6 The one who says that he abides in him must live the same way he himself lived. 7 Dear friends, I am not writing to you a new commandment, but an old commandment that you have had from the beginning. This old commandment is the word you have heard. 8 On the other hand, I am writing to you a new commandment that is truly in him and in you. For the darkness is fading away, and the true light is already shining. 9 The person who says that he is in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness. 10 The person who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no reason for him to stumble. 11 But the person who hates his brother is in the darkness and lives in the darkness. He does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes. 12 I am writing to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name. 13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you have known the one who has existed from the beginning. I am writing to you, young people, because you have overcome the evil one. 14 I have written to you, little children, because you have known the Father. I have written to you, fathers, because you have known the one who has existed from the beginning. I have written to you, young people, because you are strong and because Gods word remains in you and you have overcome the evil one. 15 Stop loving[c] the world and the things that are in the world. If anyone persists in loving the world, the Fathers love is not in him. 16 For everything that is in the worldthe desire for fleshly gratification,[d] the desire for possessions,[e] and worldly arroganceis not from the Father but is from the world. 17 And the world and its desires are fading away, but the person who does Gods will remains forever. 18 Little children, it is the last hour. Just as you heard that an antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have appeared. This is how we know it is the last hour. 19 They left us, but they were not part of us, for if they had been part of us, they would have stayed with us. Their leaving made it clear that none of them was really part of us. 20 You have an anointing from the Holy One and know all things.[f] 21 I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because lies dont come from truth. 22 Who is a liar but the person who denies that Jesus is the Messiah?[g] The person who denies the Father and the Son is an antichrist. 23 No one who denies the Son has the Father. The person who acknowledges the Son also has the Father. 24 What you have heard from the beginning must abide in you. If what you have heard from the beginning abides in you, you will also abide in the Son and in the Father. 25 The message that the Son[h] himself declared to us is eternal life. 26 I have written[i] to you about those who are trying to deceive you. 27 The anointing you received from God[j] abides in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you this.[k] Instead, because Gods[l] anointing teaches you about everything and is true and not a lie, abide in him, as he taught you to do.[m] 28 Even now, little children, abide in him. Then, when he appears, we will have confidence and will not turn away from him in shame when he comes. 29 Since you know that he is righteous, you also know that everyone who practices righteousness has been fathered by God.[n] "
Authorized (King James) Version,AKJV,1 John,2,,"My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: 2 and he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world. 3 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. 4 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 5 But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him. 6 He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked. 7 Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning. 8 Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth. 9 He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now. 10 He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him. 11 But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes. 12 I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his names sake. 13 I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father. 14 I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one. 15 Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. 17 And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever. 18 Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time. 19 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us. 20 But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things. 21 I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth. 22 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son. 23 Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: [but] he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also. 24 Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father. 25 And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life. 26 These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you. 27 But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him. 28 And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming. 29 If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him. "
King James Version,KJV,1 John,1,,"That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life; 2 (For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;) 3 That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. 4 And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full. 5 This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. 6 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth: 7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. 8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. "
King James Version,KJV,1 John,3,,"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. 2 Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. 3 And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure. 4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law. 5 And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin. 6 Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him. 7 Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous. 8 He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. 9 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. 10 In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother. 11 For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another. 12 Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous. 13 Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. 14 We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death. 15 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. 16 Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. 17 But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him? 18 My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth. 19 And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him. 20 For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. 21 Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God. 22 And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. 23 And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment. 24 And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us. "
King James Version,KJV,1 John,2,,"My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: 2 And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world. 3 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments. 4 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 5 But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him. 6 He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked. 7 Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning. 8 Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth. 9 He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now. 10 He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him. 11 But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes. 12 I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake. 13 I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father. 14 I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one. 15 Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. 17 And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever. 18 Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time. 19 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us. 20 But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things. 21 I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth. 22 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son. 23 Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also. 24 Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father. 25 And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life. 26 These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you. 27 But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him. 28 And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming. 29 If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.

King James Version,KJV,1 John,4,,"Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world. 2 Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God: 3 And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world. 4 Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. 5 They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them. 6 We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error. 7 Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. 8 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love. 9 In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. 10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. 11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. 12 No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us. 13 Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. 14 And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world. 15 Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. 16 And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. 17 Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world. 18 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love. 19 We love him, because he first loved us. 20 If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? 21 And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.

Lexham English Bible,LEB,1 John,3,"God is Love, so Love One Another","See what sort of love the Father has given to us: that we should be called children of God, and we are! Because of this the world does not know us: because it did not know him. 2 Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been revealed. We know that whenever he is revealed we will be like him, because we will see him just as he is. 3 And everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself, just as that one is pure. 4 Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness. 5 And you know that that one was revealed in order that he might take away sins, and in him there is no sin. 6 Everyone who resides in him does not sin. Everyone who sins has neither seen him nor known him. 7 Little children, let no one deceive you: the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as that one is righteous. 8 The one who practices sin is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. For this reason the Son of God was revealed: in order to destroy the works of the devil. 9 Everyone who is fathered by God does not practice sin, because his seed resides in him, and he is not able to sin, because he has been fathered by God. 10 By this the children of God and the children of the devil are evident: everyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, namely, the one who does not love his brother. 11 For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning: that we should love one another, 12 not as Cain, who was of the evil one and violently murdered his brother. And for what reason[a] did he violently murder him? Because his deeds were evil and the deeds of his brother were righteous. 13 Do not marvel,[b] brothers, if the world hates you. 14 We know that we have passed over from death to life because we love the brothers. The one who does not love remains in death. 15 Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that every murderer does not have eternal life residing in him. 16 We have come to know love by this: that he[c] laid down his life on behalf of us, and we ought to lay down our lives on behalf of the brothers. 17 But whoever has the worlds material possessions and observes his brother in need[d] and shuts his heart against him, how does the love of God reside in him? 18 Little children, let us not love with word or with tongue, but in deed and truth. 19 By this[e] we know that we are of the truth and will convince our heart before him, 20 that[f] if our heart condemns us, that God is greater than our heart and knows all things. 21 Dear friends, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God, 22 and whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do what is pleasing in his sight[g]. 23 And this is his commandment: that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he commanded us[h]. 24 And the one who keeps his commandments resides in him, and he in him. And by this we know that he resides in us: by the Spirit whom he has given to us. "
Legacy Standard Bible,LSB,1 John,4,Test the Spirits,"Beloved, do not believe every (B)spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because (C)many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that (E)confesses that (F)Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, 3 and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the (H)antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming, and (I)now it is already in the world. 4 You are from God, little children, and (K)have overcome them; because (L)greater is He who is in you than (M)he who is in the world. 5 They are from the world; therefore they speak as from the world, and the world hears them. 6 We are from God. (P)The one who knows God hears us; (Q)the one who is not from God does not hear us. From this we know (R)the spirit of truth and (S)the spirit of error. 7 Beloved, let us (U)love one another, for love is from God; and (V)everyone who loves has been [a](W)born of God and (X)knows God. 8 The one who does not love does not know God, because God is love. 9 By this the love of God was manifested [b]in us, that (AA)God has sent His [c]only begotten Son into the world so that we might live through Him. 10 In this is love, not that we have loved God, but that (AC)He loved us and sent His Son to be (AD)the propitiation for our sins. 11 Beloved, if God so loved us, (AF)we also ought to love one another. 12 No one has beheld God at any time; if we love one another, God abides in us, and His (AH)love is perfected in us. 13 By this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit. 14 We have beheld and bear witness that the Father has (AK)sent the Son to be the Savior of the world. 15 Whoever confesses that (AM)Jesus is the Son of God, God (AN)abides in him, and he in God. 16 And we have come to know and have believed the love which God has (AP)in us. (AQ)God is love, and the one who (AR)abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. 17 By this, love has been perfected with us, so that we may have (AT)confidence in (AU)the day of judgment, because (AV)as He is, so also are we in this world. 18 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear [d]involves punishment, and the one who fears is not (AX)perfected in love. 19 We love, because He first loved us. 20 If someone says, I love God, and (BA)hates his brother, he is a (BB)liar; for (BC)the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen, (BD)cannot love God whom he has not seen. 21 And this commandment we have from Him, that the one who loves God (BF)should love his brother also.

Lexham English Bible,LEB,1 John,4,How to Recognize the Spirit of God,"Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to determine if they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses Jesus Christ[a] has come in the flesh is from God, 3 and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God, and this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming, and now it is already in the world. 4 You are from God, little children, and have conquered them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. 5 They are from the world; therefore[b] they speak from the world and the world listens to them. 6 We are from God. The one who knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deceit. 7 Dear friends, let us love one another, because love is from God, and everyone who loves has been fathered by God and knows God. 8 The one who does not love does not know God, because God is love. 9 By this the love of God is revealed in us: that God sent his one and only Son into the world in order that we may live through him. 10 In this is love: not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation[c] for our sins. 11 Dear friends, if God loved us in this way, we also ought to love one another. 12 No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God resides in us and his love is perfected in us. 13 By this we know that we reside in him and he in us: that[d] he has given us of his Spirit. 14 And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world. 15 Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God resides in him and he in God. 16 And we have come to know and have believed the love that God has in us. God is love, and the one who resides in love resides in God, and God resides in him. 17 By this love is perfected with us, so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment, because just as that one is, so also are we in this world. 18 There is no fear in love, but perfect love drives out fear, because fear includes punishment, and the one who is afraid has not been perfected in love. 19 We love, because he first loved us. 20 If anyone says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar, for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen is not able to love God whom he has not seen. 21 And this is the commandment we have from him: that the one who loves God should love his brother also.

King James Version,KJV,1 John,5,,"Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him. 2 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments. 3 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous. 4 For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. 5 Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? 6 This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth. 7 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. 8 And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one. 9 If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son. 10 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. 11 And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12 He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. 13 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. 14 And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us: 15 And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him. 16 If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it. 17 All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death. 18 We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not. 19 And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness. 20 And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life. 21 Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen. "

This is (BG)the [i]antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son. 23 Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father; the one who confesses the Son has the Father also. 24 As for you, let that which you heard from the beginning abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also (BJ)will abide in the Son and in the Father. 25 And this is the promise which He Himself [j]made to us: eternal life. 26 These things I have written to you about those who are trying to deceive you. 27 And as for you, the anointing whom you received from Him abides in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you. But as His anointing (BN)teaches you about all things, and is (BO)true and is not a lie, and just as He has taught you, [k]abide in Him. 28 And now, little children, abide in Him, so that when He (BQ)is manifested, we may have (BR)confidence and (BS)not [l]shrink away from Him in shame [m]at His (BT)coming. 29 If you know that He is righteous, you know that everyone also who does righteousness (BV)has been [n]born of Him.

Legacy Standard Bible,LSB,1 John,5,Overcoming the World,"Everyone who believes that Jesus is the [a]Christ has been [b](B)born of God, and everyone who loves the [c]One who gives new birth (C)loves also the one who has been [d]born of Him. 2 By this we know that (E)we love the children of God, when we love God and do His commandments. 3 For this is the love of God, that we (G)keep His commandments; and (H)His commandments are not burdensome. 4 For everything that has been [e]born of God (J)overcomes the world; and this is the overcoming that has overcome the worldour faith. 5 Who is the one who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? 6 This is the One who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not [f]with the water only, but [g]with the water and [h]with the blood. It is (M)the Spirit who bears witness, because the Spirit is the truth. 7 For there are three that bear witness: 8 [i]the Spirit and the water and the blood; and the three are [j]in agreement. 9 If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater; for the witness of God is this, that (P)He has borne witness about His Son. 10 The one who believes in the Son of God has this witness in himself. The one who does not believe God has (R)made Him a liar, because he has not believed in the witness which God has borne witness about His Son. 11 And the witness is this, that God gave us eternal life, and (T)this life is in His Son. 12 He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have that life. 13 These things I have written to you who (W)believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have (X)eternal life. 14 And this is the confidence which we have [k]before Him, that, (Z)if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. 15 And if we know that He hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests which we have asked from Him. 16 If anyone sees his brother [l]committing a sin not leading to death, he shall ask and [m]God will for him give life to those who commit sin not leading to death. (AC)There is a sin leading to death; (AD)I do not say that he should make request for this. 17 All unrighteousness is sin, and (AF)there is a sin not leading to death. 18 We know that (AH)no one who has been [n]born of God sins; but He who was [o]begotten of God (AI)keeps him, and (AJ)the evil one does not (AK)touch him. 19 We know that (AM)we are of God, and that (AN)the whole world lies in the power of the evil one. 20 And we know that (AP)the Son of God has come, and has (AQ)given us understanding so that we may know (AR)Him who is true; and we (AS)are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ.

Authorized (King James) Version,AKJV,1 John,5,,"Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him. 2 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments. 3 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous. 4 For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. 5 Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? 6 This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth. 7 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. 8 And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one. 9 If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son. 10 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. 11 And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12 He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. 13 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. 14 And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us: 15 and if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him. 16 If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it. 17 All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death. 18 We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not. 19 And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness. 20 And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life. 21 Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen. "
Living Bible,TLB,1 John,1,,"Christ was alive when the world began, yet I myself have seen him with my own eyes and listened to him speak. I have touched him with my own hands. He is Gods message of life. 2 This one who is life from God has been shown to us, and we guarantee that we have seen him; I am speaking of Christ, who is eternal Life. He was with the Father and then was shown to us. 3 Again I say, we are telling you about what we ourselves have actually seen and heard, so that you may share the fellowship and the joys we have with the Father and with Jesus Christ his son. 4 And if you do as I say in this letter, then you, too, will be full of joy, and so will we. 5 This is the message God has given us to pass on to you: that God is Light and in him is no darkness at all. 6 So if we say we are his friends but go on living in spiritual darkness and sin, we are lying. 7 But if we are living in the light of Gods presence, just as Christ does, then we have wonderful fellowship and joy with each other, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from every sin. 8 If we say that we have no sin, we are only fooling ourselves and refusing to accept the truth. 9 But if we confess our sins to him,[a] he can be depended on to forgive us and to cleanse us from every wrong. And it is perfectly proper for God to do this for us because Christ died to wash away our sins. 10 If we claim we have not sinned, we are lying and calling God a liar, for he says we have sinned. "
Lexham English Bible,LEB,1 John,5,God Has Given Us Eternal Life in the Son,"Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been fathered by God, and everyone who loves the father[a] also loves the child fathered by him. 2 By this we know that we love the children of God: whenever we love God and keep his commandments. 3 For this is the love of God: that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome, 4 because everyone who is fathered by God conquers the world. And this is the victory which has conquered the world: our faith. 5 Now who is the one who conquers the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? 6 This is the one who came by water and bloodJesus Christ, not with the water only, but with the water and with the blood. And the Spirit is the one who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. 7 For there are three that testify,[b] 8 the Spirit and the water and the blood, and the three are in agreement[c]. 9 If we receive the testimony of people, the testimony of God is greater, because this is the testimony of God that he has testified concerning his Son. 10 (The one who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. The one who does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has testified concerning his Son.) 11 And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12 The one who has the Son has the life; the one who does not have the Son of God does not have the life. 13 These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, in order that you may know that you have eternal life. 14 And this is the confidence that we have before him: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. 15 And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests that we have asked from him. 16 If anyone should see his brother sinning a sin not leading to death, he should ask, and he will grant life to him, to those who sin not leading to death. (There is a sin leading to death; I do not say that he should ask about that. 17 All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not leading to death.) 18 We know that everyone who is fathered by God does not sin, but the one fathered by God, he protects him, and the evil one does not touch him. 19 We know that we are from God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one. 20 And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, in order that we may know the one who is true, and we are in the one who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ.

Living Bible,TLB,1 John,2,,"My little children, I am telling you this so that you will stay away from sin. But if you sin, there is someone to plead for you before the Father. His name is Jesus Christ, the one who is all that is good and who pleases God completely. 2 He is the one who took Gods wrath against our sins upon himself and brought us into fellowship with God; and he is the forgiveness for our sins,[a] and not only ours but all the worlds. 3 And how can we be sure that we belong to him? By looking within ourselves: are we really trying to do what he wants us to? 4 Someone may say, I am a Christian; I am on my way to heaven; I belong to Christ. But if he doesnt do what Christ tells him to, he is a liar. 5 But those who do what Christ tells them to will learn to love God more and more. That is the way to know whether or not you are a Christian. 6 Anyone who says he is a Christian should live as Christ did. 7 Dear brothers, I am not writing out a new rule for you to obey, for it is an old one you have always had, right from the start. You have heard it all before. 8 Yet it is always new, and works for you just as it did for Christ; and as we obey this commandment, to love one another, the darkness in our lives disappears and the new light of life in Christ shines in. 9 Anyone who says he is walking in the light of Christ but dislikes his fellow man is still in darkness. 10 But whoever loves his fellow man is walking in the light and can see his way without stumbling around in darkness and sin. 11 For he who dislikes his brother is wandering in spiritual darkness and doesnt know where he is going, for the darkness has made him blind so that he cannot see the way. 12 I am writing these things to all of you, my little children, because your sins have been forgiven in the name of Jesus our Savior. 13 I am saying these things to you older men because you really know Christ, the one who has been alive from the beginning. And you young men, I am talking to you because you have won your battle with Satan. And I am writing to you younger boys and girls because you, too, have learned to know God our Father. 14 And so I say to you fathers who know the eternal God, and to you young men who are strong with Gods Word in your hearts, and have won your struggle against Satan: 15 Stop loving this evil world and all that it offers you, for when you love these things you show that you do not really love God; 16 for all these worldly things, these evil desiresthe craze for sex, the ambition to buy everything that appeals to you, and the pride that comes from wealth and importancethese are not from God. They are from this evil world itself. 17 And this world is fading away, and these evil, forbidden things will go with it, but whoever keeps doing the will of God will live forever. 18 Dear children, this worlds last hour has come. You have heard about the Antichrist who is comingthe one who is against Christand already many such persons have appeared. This makes us all the more certain that the end of the world is near. 19 These against-Christ people used to be members of our churches, but they never really belonged with us or else they would have stayed. When they left us it proved that they were not of us at all. 20 But you are not like that, for the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you know the truth. 21 So I am not writing to you as to those who need to know the truth, but I warn you as those who can discern the difference between true and false. 22 And who is the greatest liar? The one who says that Jesus is not Christ. Such a person is antichrist, for he does not believe in God the Father and in his Son. 23 For a person who doesnt believe in Christ, Gods Son, cant have God the Father either. But he who has Christ, Gods Son, has God the Father also. 24 So keep on believing what you have been taught from the beginning. If you do, you will always be in close fellowship with both God the Father and his Son. 25 And he himself has promised us this: eternal life. 26 These remarks of mine about the Antichrist are pointed at those who would dearly love to blindfold you and lead you astray. 27 But you have received the Holy Spirit, and he lives within you, in your hearts, so that you dont need anyone to teach you what is right. For he teaches you all things, and he is the Truth, and no liar; and so, just as he has said, you must live in Christ, never to depart from him. 28 And now, my little children, stay in happy fellowship with the Lord so that when he comes you will be sure that all is well and will not have to be ashamed and shrink back from meeting him. 29 Since we know that God is always good and does only right, we may rightly assume that all those who do right are his children.

Legacy Standard Bible,LSB,1 John,3,"Children of God, Love One Another","See [a]how great a love the Father has given to us, that we would be called (B)children of God; and we are. For this reason the world does not know us, because (C)it did not know Him. 2 Beloved, now we are (E)children of God, and (F)it has not been manifested as yet what we will be. We know that when He (G)is manifested, we will be (H)like Him, because we will (I)see Him just as He is. 3 And everyone who has this hope fixed on Him (K)purifies himself, just as He is pure. 4 Everyone who does sin also does lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness. 5 And you know that He was manifested in order to (N)take away sins, and (O)in Him there is no sin. 6 No one who abides in Him sins; no one who sins has seen Him or [b](Q)has come to know Him. 7 Little children, let no one (S)deceive you. (T)The one who does righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous. 8 The one who does sin is of the devil, because the devil sins from the beginning. (V)The Son of God (W)was manifested for this purpose, (X)to destroy the works of the devil. 9 Everyone who has been [c]born of God (Z)does not sin, because His seed abides in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been [d]born of God. 10 By this the children of God and the (AB)children of the devil are manifested: everyone who does not do righteousness is not of God, as well as the one who (AC)does not love his (AD)brother. 11 For this is the message (AF)which you have heard from the beginning, (AG)that we should love one another; 12 not as Cain, who was of (AI)the evil one and slew his brother. And for what reason did he slay him? Because (AJ)his deeds were evil, and his brothers were righteous. 13 Do not marvel, brothers, if the world hates you. 14 We know that we have passed out of death into life, (AM)because we love the brothers. The one who does not love abides in death. 15 Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that (AO)no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. 16 By this we have known love, that He laid down His life for us; and (AQ)we ought to lay down our lives for the (AR)brothers. 17 But whoever has the worlds goods, and sees his brother in need and (AT)closes his [e]heart [f]against him, (AU)how does the love of God abide in him? 18 Little children, let us not love with word or with tongue, but in deed and (AW)truth. 19 And by this we will know that we are of the truth, and will [g]assure our heart before Him 20 [h]in whatever our heart condemns us; for God is greater than our heart and knows all things. 21 Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have (AZ)confidence [i]before God; 22 and whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we (BB)keep His commandments and do (BC)the things that are pleasing in His sight. 23 And this is His commandment, that we [j]believe in (BE)the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, just as (BF)He gave a commandment to us. 24 And the one who keeps His commandments (BH)abides in Him, and He in him.

By this we know that we are in him. 6 The one who says that he resides in him ought also to walk[c] just as that one walked. 7 Dear friends, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the message which you have heard. 8 Again, I am writing a new commandment to you, which is true in him and in you, because[d] the darkness is passing away and the true light already is shining. 9 The one who says he is in the light and hates his brother is in the darkness until now. 10 The one who loves his brother resides in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling in him. 11 But the one who hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes. 12 I am writing to you, little children, because[e] your sins have been forgiven you on account of his name. 13 I am writing to you, fathers, because[f] you have known the One who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because[g] you have conquered the evil one. 14 I have written to you, children, because[h] you have known the Father. I have written to you, fathers, because[i] you have known the One who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because[j] you are strong, and the word of God resides in you, and you have conquered the evil one. 15 Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him, 16 because everything that is in the worldthe desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the arrogance of material possessionsis not from the Father, but is from the world. 17 And the world is passing away, and its desire,[k] but the one who does the will of God remains forever[l]. 18 Children, it is the last hour, and just as you have heard that antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have arisen, by which we know that it is the last hour. 19 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us. But they went out[m], in order that it might be shown that all of them are not of us. 20 And you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know. 21 I have not written to you because[n] you do not know the truth, but because[o] you do know it, and because[p] every lie is not of the truth. 22 Who is the liar except the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This person is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son. 23 Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; the one who confesses the Son has the Father also. 24 As for you, what you have heard from the beginning must remain in you. If what you have heard from the beginning remains in you, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. 25 And this is the promise which he himself promised us: eternal life. 26 These things I have written to you concerning the ones who are trying to deceive you. 27 And as for you, the anointing which you received from him remains in you, and you do not have need that anyone teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things, and is true and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you reside[q] in him. 28 And now, little children, remain in him, so that whenever he is revealed we may have confidence and not be put to shame before him at his coming. 29 If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone[r] who practices righteousness has been fathered by him.

The Message,MSG,1 John,2,The Only Way to Know Were in Him,"1-2 I write this, dear children, to guide you out of sin. But if anyone does sin, we have a Priest-Friend in the presence of the Father: Jesus Christ, righteous Jesus. When he served as a sacrifice for our sins, he solved the sin problem for goodnot only ours, but the whole worlds. 2-3 Heres how we can be sure that we know God in the right way: Keep his commandments. 4-6 If someone claims, I know him well! but doesnt keep his commandments, hes obviously a liar. His life doesnt match his words. But the one who keeps Gods word is the person in whom we see Gods mature love. This is the only way to be sure were in God. Anyone who claims to be intimate with God ought to live the same kind of life Jesus lived. 7-8 My dear friends, Im not writing anything new here. This is the oldest commandment in the book, and youve known it from day one. Its always been implicit in the Message youve heard. On the other hand, perhaps it is new, freshly minted as it is in both Christ and youthe darkness fading away and the True Light already blazing! 9-11 Anyone who claims to live in Gods light and hates a brother or sister is still in the dark. Its the person who loves brother and sister who dwells in Gods light and doesnt block the light from others. But whoever hates is still in the dark, stumbles around in the dark, doesnt know which end is up, blinded by the darkness. 12-13 I remind you, my dear children: Your sins are forgiven in Jesus name. You veterans were in on the ground floor, and know the One who started all this; you newcomers have won a big victory over the Evil One. 13-14 And a second reminder, dear children: You know the Father from personal experience. You veterans know the One who started it all; and you newcomerssuch vitality and strength! Gods word is so steady in you. Your fellowship with God enables you to gain a victory over the Evil One. 15-17 Dont love the worlds ways. Dont love the worlds goods. Love of the world squeezes out love for the Father. Practically everything that goes on in the worldwanting your own way, wanting everything for yourself, wanting to appear importanthas nothing to do with the Father. It just isolates you from him. The world and all its wanting, wanting, wanting is on the way outbut whoever does what God wants is set for eternity. 18 Children, time is just about up. You heard that Antichrist is coming. Well, theyre all over the place, antichrists everywhere you look. Thats how we know that were close to the end. 19 They left us, but they were never really with us. If they had been, they would have stuck it out with us, loyal to the end. In leaving, they showed their true colors, showed they never did belong. 20-21 But you belong. The Holy One anointed you, and you all know it. I havent been writing this to tell you something you dont know, but to confirm the truth you do know, and to remind you that the truth doesnt breed lies. 22-23 So who is lying here? Its the person who denies that Jesus is the Divine Christ, thats who. This is what makes an antichrist: denying the Father, denying the Son. No one who denies the Son has any part with the Father, but affirming the Son is an embrace of the Father as well. 24-25 Stay with what you heard from the beginning, the original message. Let it sink into your life. If what you heard from the beginning lives deeply in you, you will live deeply in both Son and Father. This is exactly what Christ promised: eternal life, real life! 26-27 Ive written to warn you about those who are trying to deceive you. But theyre no match for what is embedded deeply within youChrists anointing, no less! You dont need any of their so-called teaching. Christs anointing teaches you the truth on everything you need to know about yourself and him, uncontaminated by a single lie. Live deeply in what you were taught. 28 And now, children, stay with Christ. Live deeply in Christ. Then well be ready for him when he appears, ready to receive him with open arms, with no cause for red-faced guilt or lame excuses when he arrives. 29 Once youre convinced that he is right and righteous, youll recognize that all who practice righteousness are Gods true children. "
The Message,MSG,1 John,3,When We Practice Real Love,"What marvelous love the Father has extended to us! Just look at itwere called children of God! Thats who we really are. But thats also why the world doesnt recognize us or take us seriously, because it has no idea who he is or what hes up to. 2-3 But friends, thats exactly who we are: children of God. And thats only the beginning. Who knows how well end up! What we know is that when Christ is openly revealed, well see himand in seeing him, become like him. All of us who look forward to his Coming stay ready, with the glistening purity of Jesus life as a model for our own. 4-6 All who indulge in a sinful life are dangerously lawless, for sin is a major disruption of Gods order. Surely you know that Christ showed up in order to get rid of sin. There is no sin in him, and sin is not part of his program. No one who lives deeply in Christ makes a practice of sin. None of those who do practice sin have taken a good look at Christ. Theyve got him all backward. 7-8 So, my dear children, dont let anyone divert you from the truth. Its the person who acts right who is right, just as we see it lived out in our righteous Messiah. Those who make a practice of sin are straight from the Devil, the pioneer in the practice of sin. The Son of God entered the scene to abolish the Devils ways. 9-10 People conceived and brought into life by God dont make a practice of sin. How could they? Gods seed is deep within them, making them who they are. Its not in the nature of the God-born to practice and parade sin. Heres how you tell the difference between Gods children and the Devils children: The one who wont practice righteous ways isnt from God, nor is the one who wont love brother or sister. A simple test. * * * 11 For this is the original message we heard: We should love each other. 12-13 We must not be like Cain, who joined the Evil One and then killed his brother. And why did he kill him? Because he was deep in the practice of evil, while the acts of his brother were righteous. So dont be surprised, friends, when the world hates you. This has been going on a long time. 14-15 The way we know weve been transferred from death to life is that we love our brothers and sisters. Anyone who doesnt love is as good as dead. Anyone who hates a brother or sister is a murderer, and you know very well that eternal life and murder dont go together. 16-17 This is how weve come to understand and experience love: Christ sacrificed his life for us. This is why we ought to live sacrificially for our fellow believers, and not just be out for ourselves. If you see some brother or sister in need and have the means to do something about it but turn a cold shoulder and do nothing, what happens to Gods love? It disappears. And you made it disappear. 18-20 My dear children, lets not just talk about love; lets practice real love. This is the only way well know were living truly, living in Gods reality. Its also the way to shut down debilitating self-criticism, even when there is something to it. For God is greater than our worried hearts and knows more about us than we do ourselves. 21-24 And friends, once thats taken care of and were no longer accusing or condemning ourselves, were bold and free before God! Were able to stretch our hands out and receive what we asked for because were doing what he said, doing what pleases him. Again, this is Gods command: to believe in his personally named Son, Jesus Christ. He told us to love each other, in line with the original command. As we keep his commands, we live deeply and surely in him, and he lives in us. And this is how we experience his deep and abiding presence in us: by the Spirit he gave us. "
Living Bible,TLB,1 John,5,,"If you believe that Jesus is the Christthat he is Gods Son and your Saviorthen you are a child of God. And all who love the Father love his children too. 2 So you can find out how much you love Gods childrenyour brothers and sisters in the Lordby how much you love and obey God. 3 Loving God means doing what he tells us to do, and really, that isnt hard at all; 4 for every child of God can obey him, defeating sin and evil pleasure by trusting Christ to help him. 5 But who could possibly fight and win this battle except by believing that Jesus is truly the Son of God? 6-8 And we know he is, because God said so with a voice from heaven when Jesus was baptized, and again as he was facing death[a]yes, not only at his baptism but also as he faced death. And the Holy Spirit, forever truthful, says it too. So we have these three witnesses: the voice of the Holy Spirit in our hearts, the voice from heaven at Christs baptism, and the voice before he died. And they all say the same thing: that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. 9 We believe men who witness in our courts, and so surely we can believe whatever God declares. And God declares that Jesus is his Son. 10 All who believe this know in their hearts that it is true. If anyone doesnt believe this, he is actually calling God a liar because he doesnt believe what God has said about his Son. 11 And what is it that God has said? That he has given us eternal life and that this life is in his Son. 12 So whoever has Gods Son has life; whoever does not have his Son, does not have life. 13 I have written this to you who believe in the Son of God so that you may know you have eternal life. 14 And we are sure of this, that he will listen to us whenever we ask him for anything in line with his will. 15 And if we really know he is listening when we talk to him and make our requests, then we can be sure that he will answer us. 16 If you see a Christian sinning in a way that does not end in death, you should ask God to forgive him, and God will give him life unless he has sinned that one fatal sin. But there is that one sin which ends in death, and if he has done that, there is no use praying for him. 17 Every wrong is a sin, of course. Im not talking about these ordinary sins; I am speaking of that one that ends in death.[b] 18 No one who has become part of Gods family makes a practice of sinning, for Christ, Gods Son, holds him securely, and the devil cannot get his hands on him. 19 We know that we are children of God and that all the rest of the world around us is under Satans power and control. 20 And we know that Christ, Gods Son, has come to help us understand and find the true God. And now we are in God because we are in Jesus Christ his Son, who is the only true God; and he is eternal Life. 21 Dear children, keep away from anything that might take Gods place in your hearts. Amen. Sincerely, John "
Modern English Version,MEV,1 John,1,The Word of Life,"That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have touched, concerning the Word of life 2 the life was revealed, and we have seen it and testify to it, and announce to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was revealed to us 3 we declare to you that which we have seen and heard, that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ. 4 We are writing these things to you so that our joy may be complete. 5 This then is the message which we have heard from Him and declare to you: God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all. 6 If we say that we have fellowship with Him, yet walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth. 7 But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin. 8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar and His word is not in us. "
The Message,MSG,1 John,1,Walk in the Light,"1-2 From the very first day, we were there, taking it all inwe heard it with our own ears, saw it with our own eyes, verified it with our own hands. The Word of Life appeared right before our eyes; we saw it happen! And now were telling you in most sober prose that what we witnessed was, incredibly, this: The infinite Life of God himself took shape before us. 3-4 We saw it, we heard it, and now were telling you so you can experience it along with us, this experience of communion with the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ. Our motive for writing is simply this: We want you to enjoy this, too. Your joy will double our joy! 5 This, in essence, is the message we heard from Christ and are passing on to you: God is light, pure light; theres not a trace of darkness in him. 6-7 If we claim that we experience a shared life with him and continue to stumble around in the dark, were obviously lying through our teethwere not living what we claim. But if we walk in the light, God himself being the light, we also experience a shared life with one another, as the sacrificed blood of Jesus, Gods Son, purges all our sin. 8-10 If we claim that were free of sin, were only fooling ourselves. A claim like that is errant nonsense. On the other hand, if we admit our sinssimply come clean about themhe wont let us down; hell be true to himself. Hell forgive our sins and purge us of all wrongdoing. If we claim that weve never sinned, we out-and-out contradict Godmake a liar out of him. A claim like that only shows off our ignorance of God. "
Modern English Version,MEV,1 John,3,Love One Another,"Consider how much love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God. Therefore the world does not know us, because it did not know Him. 2 Beloved, now are we children of God, and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be. But we know that when He appears, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is. 3 Everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure. 4 Whoever practices sin breaks the law, for sin is lawlessness. 5 You know that He was revealed to take away our sins, and in Him there is no sin. 6 Whoever remains in Him does not sin. Whoever sins has not seen Him and does not know Him. 7 Little children, let no one deceive you. The one who does righteousness is righteous, just as Christ is righteous. 8 Whoever practices sin is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was revealed, that He might destroy the works of the devil. 9 Whoever has been born of God does not practice sin, for His seed remains in him. And he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God. 10 In this the children of God and the children of the devil are revealed: Whoever does not live in righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother. 11 For this is the message that you heard from the beginning: We should love one another, 12 not like Cain, who was of the wicked one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own works were evil, and his brothers works were righteous. 13 Do not marvel, my brothers, if the world hates you. 14 We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brothers. Whoever does not love his brother remains in death. 15 Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him. 16 By this we know the love of God: that He laid down His life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers. 17 Whoever has the worlds goods and sees his brother in need, but closes his heart of compassion from him, how can the love of God remain in him? 18 My little children, let us love not in word and speech, but in action and truth. 19 By this we know that we are of the truth, and shall reassure our hearts before Him. 20 For if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart and knows everything. 21 Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, then we have confidence before God. 22 And whatever we ask, we will receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight. 23 And this is His commandment: that we should believe on the name of His Son Jesus Christ and love one another as He commanded us. 24 Now the one who keeps His commandments remains in Him, and He in him. And by this we know that He remains in us, through the Spirit whom He has given us. "
The Message,MSG,1 John,4,Dont Believe Everything You Hear,"My dear friends, dont believe everything you hear. Carefully weigh and examine what people tell you. Not everyone who talks about God comes from God. There are a lot of lying preachers loose in the world. 2-3 Heres how you test for the genuine Spirit of God. Everyone who confesses openly his faith in Jesus Christthe Son of God, who came as an actual flesh-and-blood personcomes from God and belongs to God. And everyone who refuses to confess faith in Jesus has nothing in common with God. This is the spirit of antichrist that you heard was coming. Well, here it is, sooner than we thought! 4-6 My dear children, you come from God and belong to God. You have already won a big victory over those false teachers, for the Spirit in you is far stronger than anything in the world. These people belong to the Christ-denying world. They talk the worlds language and the world eats it up. But we come from God and belong to God. Anyone who knows God understands us and listens. The person who has nothing to do with God will, of course, not listen to us. This is another test for telling the Spirit of Truth from the spirit of deception. 7-10 My beloved friends, let us continue to love each other since love comes from God. Everyone who loves is born of God and experiences a relationship with God. The person who refuses to love doesnt know the first thing about God, because God is loveso you cant know him if you dont love. This is how God showed his love for us: God sent his only Son into the world so we might live through him. This is the kind of love we are talking aboutnot that we once upon a time loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as a sacrifice to clear away our sins and the damage theyve done to our relationship with God. 11-12 My dear, dear friends, if God loved us like this, we certainly ought to love each other. No one has seen God, ever. But if we love one another, God dwells deeply within us, and his love becomes complete in usperfect love! 13-16 This is how we know were living steadily and deeply in him, and he in us: Hes given us life from his life, from his very own Spirit. Also, weve seen for ourselves and continue to state openly that the Father sent his Son as Savior of the world. Everyone who confesses that Jesus is Gods Son participates continuously in an intimate relationship with God. We know it so well, weve embraced it heart and soul, this love that comes from God. 17-18 God is love. When we take up permanent residence in a life of love, we live in God and God lives in us. This way, love has the run of the house, becomes at home and mature in us, so that were free of worry on Judgment Dayour standing in the world is identical with Christs. There is no room in love for fear. Well-formed love banishes fear. Since fear is crippling, a fearful lifefear of death, fear of judgmentis one not yet fully formed in love. 19 We, though, are going to lovelove and be loved. First we were loved, now we love. He loved us first. 20-21 If anyone boasts, I love God, and goes right on hating his brother or sister, thinking nothing of it, he is a liar. If he wont love the person he can see, how can he love the God he cant see? The command we have from Christ is blunt: Loving God includes loving people. Youve got to love both. "
Living Bible,TLB,1 John,3,,"See how very much our heavenly Father loves us, for he allows us to be called his childrenthink of itand we really are! But since most people dont know God, naturally they dont understand that we are his children. 2 Yes, dear friends, we are already Gods children, right now, and we cant even imagine what it is going to be like later on. But we do know this, that when he comes we will be like him, as a result of seeing him as he really is. 3 And everyone who really believes this will try to stay pure because Christ is pure. 4 But those who keep on sinning are against God, for every sin is done against the will of God. 5 And you know that he became a man so that he could take away our sins, and that there is no sin in him, no missing of Gods will at any time in any way. 6 So if we stay close to him, obedient to him, we wont be sinning either; but as for those who keep on sinning, they should realize this: They sin because they have never really known him or become his. 7 Oh, dear children, dont let anyone deceive you about this: if you are constantly doing what is good, it is because you are good, even as he is. 8 But if you keep on sinning, it shows that you belong to Satan, who since he first began to sin has kept steadily at it. But the Son of God came to destroy these works of the devil. 9 The person who has been born into Gods family does not make a practice of sinning because now Gods life is in him; so he cant keep on sinning, for this new life has been born into him and controls himhe has been born again. 10 So now we can tell who is a child of God and who belongs to Satan. Whoever is living a life of sin and doesnt love his brother shows that he is not in Gods family; 11 for the message to us from the beginning has been that we should love one another. 12 We are not to be like Cain, who belonged to Satan and killed his brother. Why did he kill him? Because Cain had been doing wrong and he knew very well that his brothers life was better than his. 13 So dont be surprised, dear friends, if the world hates you. 14 If we love other Christians, it proves that we have been delivered from hell and given eternal life. But a person who doesnt have love for others is headed for eternal death. 15 Anyone who hates his Christian brother is really a murderer at heart; and you know that no one wanting to murder has eternal life within. 16 We know what real love is from Christs example in dying for us. And so we also ought to lay down our lives for our Christian brothers. 17 But if someone who is supposed to be a Christian has money enough to live well, and sees a brother in need, and wont help himhow can Gods love be within him? 18 Little children, let us stop just saying we love people; let us really love them, and show it by our actions. 19 Then we will know for sure, by our actions, that we are on Gods side, and our consciences will be clear, even when we stand before the Lord. 20 But if we have bad consciences and feel that we have done wrong, the Lord will surely feel it even more,[a] for he knows everything we do. 21 But, dearly loved friends, if our consciences are clear, we can come to the Lord with perfect assurance and trust, 22 and get whatever we ask for because we are obeying him and doing the things that please him. 23 And this is what God says we must do: Believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another. 24 Those who do what God saysthey are living with God and he with them. We know this is true because the Holy Spirit he has given us tells us so. "
The Message,MSG,1 John,5,The Power That Brings the World to Its Knees,"1-3 Every person who believes that Jesus is, in fact, the Messiah, is God-born. If we love the One who conceives the child, well surely love the child who was conceived. The reality test on whether or not we love Gods children is this: Do we love God? Do we keep his commands? The proof that we love God comes when we keep his commandments and they are not at all troublesome. 4-5 Every God-born person conquers the worlds ways. The conquering power that brings the world to its knees is our faith. The person who wins out over the worlds ways is simply the one who believes Jesus is the Son of God. 6-8 Jesusthe Divine Christ! He experienced a life-giving birth and a death-killing death. Not only birth from the womb, but baptismal birth of his ministry and sacrificial death. And all the while the Spirit is confirming the truth, the reality of Gods presence at Jesus baptism and crucifixion, bringing those occasions alive for us. A triple testimony: the Spirit, the Baptism, the Crucifixion. And the three in perfect agreement. 9-10 If we take human testimony at face value, how much more should we be reassured when God gives testimony as he does here, testifying concerning his Son. Whoever believes in the Son of God inwardly confirms Gods testimony. Whoever refuses to believe in effect calls God a liar, refusing to believe Gods own testimony regarding his Son. 11-12 This is the testimony in essence: God gave us eternal life; the life is in his Son. So, whoever has the Son, has life; whoever rejects the Son, rejects life. 13-15 My purpose in writing is simply this: that you who believe in Gods Son will know beyond the shadow of a doubt that you have eternal life, the reality and not the illusion. And how bold and free we then become in his presence, freely asking according to his will, sure that hes listening. And if were confident that hes listening, we know that what weve asked for is as good as ours. 16-17 For instance, if we see a Christian believer sinning (clearly Im not talking about those who make a practice of sin in a way that is fatal, leading to eternal death), we ask for Gods help and he gladly gives it, gives life to the sinner whose sin is not fatal. There is such a thing as a fatal sin, and Im not urging you to pray about that. Everything we do wrong is sin, but not all sin is fatal. 18-21 We know that none of the God-born makes a practice of sinfatal sin. The God-born are also the God-protected. The Evil One cant lay a hand on them. We know that we are held firm by God; its only the people of the world who continue in the grip of the Evil One. And we know that the Son of God came so we could recognize and understand the truth of Godwhat a gift!and we are living in the Truth itself, in Gods Son, Jesus Christ. This Jesus is both True God and Real Life. Dear children, be on guard against all clever facsimiles. "
Modern English Version,MEV,1 John,2,Christ Our Advocate,"My little children, I am writing these things to you, so that you do not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous One. 2 He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world. 3 By this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. 4 Whoever says, I know Him, and does not keep His commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 5 But whoever keeps His word truly has the love of God perfected in him. By this we know we are in Him. 6 Whoever says he remains in Him ought to walk as He walked. 7 Brothers, I am writing no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard from the beginning. 8 Yet a new commandment I am writing to you, which holds true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining. 9 Whoever says he is in the light but hates his brother is in darkness even until now. 10 Whoever loves his brother lives in the light, and in him there is no cause for stumbling. 11 But whoever hates his brother is in darkness, and walks in darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes. 12 I am writing to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven for His names sake. 13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you have known Him who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I am writing to you, little children, because you have known the Father. 14 I have written to you, fathers, because you have known Him who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you, and you have overcome the evil one. 15 Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in the worldthe lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of lifeis not of the Father, but is of the world. 17 The world and its desires are passing away, but the one who does the will of God lives forever. 18 Little children, it is the last hour. As you have heard that the antichrist will come, even now there are many antichrists. By this we know that it is the last hour. 19 They went out from us, but they were not of us, for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have remained with us. But they went out, revealing that none of them were of us. 20 But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know all things. 21 I have written to you, not because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth. 22 Who is a liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? Whoever denies the Father and the Son is the antichrist. 23 No one who denies the Son has the Father; the one who confesses the Son has the Father. 24 Let that which you have heard from the beginning remain in you. If that which you have heard from the beginning remains in you, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. 25 And this is the promise that He has promised useternal life. 26 I have written these things to you concerning those who deceive you. 27 But the anointing which you have received from Him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. For as the same anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and just as it has taught you, remain in Him. 28 And now, little children, remain in Him, so that when He appears, we may have confidence and not be ashamed before Him when He comes. 29 If you know that He is righteous, you know that everyone who does righteousness is born of Him. "
Living Bible,TLB,1 John,4,,"Dearly loved friends, dont always believe everything you hear just because someone says it is a message from God: test it first to see if it really is. For there are many false teachers around, 2 and the way to find out if their message is from the Holy Spirit is to ask: Does it really agree that Jesus Christ, Gods Son, actually became man with a human body? If so, then the message is from God. 3 If not, the message is not from God but from one who is against Christ, like the Antichrist you have heard about who is going to come, and his attitude of enmity against Christ is already abroad in the world. 4 Dear young friends, you belong to God and have already won your fight with those who are against Christ because there is someone in your hearts who is stronger than any evil teacher in this wicked world. 5 These men belong to this world, so, quite naturally, they are concerned about worldly affairs and the world pays attention to them. 6 But we are children of God; that is why only those who have walked and talked with God will listen to us. Others wont. That is another way to know whether a message is really from God; for if it is, the world wont listen to it. 7 Dear friends, let us practice loving each other, for love comes from God and those who are loving and kind show that they are the children of God, and that they are getting to know him better. 8 But if a person isnt loving and kind, it shows that he doesnt know Godfor God is love. 9 God showed how much he loved us by sending his only Son into this wicked world to bring to us eternal life through his death. 10 In this act we see what real love is: it is not our love for God but his love for us when he sent his Son to satisfy Gods anger against our sins. 11 Dear friends, since God loved us as much as that, we surely ought to love each other too. 12 For though we have never yet seen God, when we love each other God lives in us, and his love within us grows ever stronger. 13 And he has put his own Holy Spirit into our hearts as a proof to us that we are living with him and he with us. 14 And furthermore, we have seen with our own eyes and now tell all the world that God sent his Son to be their Savior. 15 Anyone who believes and says that Jesus is the Son of God has God living in him, and he is living with God. 16 We know how much God loves us because we have felt his love and because we believe him when he tells us that he loves us dearly. God is love, and anyone who lives in love is living with God and God is living in him. 17 And as we live with Christ, our love grows more perfect and complete; so we will not be ashamed and embarrassed at the day of judgment, but can face him with confidence and joy because he loves us and we love him too. 18 We need have no fear of someone who loves us perfectly; his perfect love for us eliminates all dread of what he might do to us. If we are afraid, it is for fear of what he might do to us and shows that we are not fully convinced that he really loves us. 19 So you see, our love for him comes as a result of his loving us first. 20 If anyone says I love God, but keeps on hating his brother, he is a liar; for if he doesnt love his brother who is right there in front of him, how can he love God whom he has never seen? 21 And God himself has said that one must love not only God but his brother too.

Modern English Version,MEV,1 John,4,Test the Spirits,"Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 This is how you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, 3 and every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and is already in the world. 4 You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world. 5 They are of the world, and therefore they speak from the world, and the world listens to them. 6 We are of God, and whoever knows God listens to us. Whoever is not of God does not listen to us. This is how we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error. 7 Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God, and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. 8 Anyone who does not love does not know God, for God is love. 9 In this way the love of God was revealed to us, that God sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him. 10 In this is love: not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins. 11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we must also love one another. 12 No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwells in us, and His love is perfected in us. 13 We know that we live in Him, and He in us, because He has given us His Spirit. 14 And we have seen and testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the world. 15 Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in him, and he in God. 16 And we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in him. 17 In this way Gods love is perfected in us, so that we may have boldness on the Day of Judgment, because as He is, so are we in this world. 18 There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. Whoever fears is not perfect in love. 19 We love Him because He first loved us. 20 If anyone says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar. For whoever does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen? 21 We have this commandment from Him: Whoever loves God must also love his brother. "

Modern English Version,MEV,1 John,5,Overcoming the World,"Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the Father loves the one born of the Father. 2 By this we know that we love the children of God: when we love God and keep His commandments. 3 For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments. And His commandments are not burdensome, 4 for whoever is born of God overcomes the world, and the victory that overcomes the world is our faith. 5 Who is it that overcomes the world, but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? 6 This is He who came by water and bloodJesus Christ. He did not come by water only, but by water and blood. It is the Spirit who bears witness, because the Spirit is the truth. 7 There are three who testify in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and the three are one. 8 There are three that testify on earth: the Spirit, the water, and the blood, and the three are toward the one.[a] 9 If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater; for this is the testimony of God which He has given concerning His Son. 10 Whoever believes in the Son of God has this witness in himself. Whoever does not believe God has made Him out to be a liar, because he does not believe the testimony that God gave about His Son. 11 And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. 12 Whoever has the Son has life, and whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life. 13 I have written these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God. 14 This is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. 15 So if we know that He hears whatever we ask, we know that we have whatever we asked of Him. 16 If anyone sees his brother commit a sin which does not lead to death, he shall ask, and He shall give him life. This is for those whose sin does not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I do not say that he should pray for it. 17 All wrongdoing is sin, but there is a sin that does not lead to death. 18 We know that whoever is born of God does not keep on sinning. But whoever has been born of God guards himself, and the wicked one cannot touch him. 19 We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in wickedness. 20 And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know Him who is true, and we are in Him who is trueHis Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life. 21 Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen. "
New American Bible (Revised Edition),NABRE,1 John,3,Chapter 3,"1 [a]See what love the Father has bestowed on us that we may be called the children of God. Yet so we are. The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him. 2 Beloved, we are Gods children now; what we shall be has not yet been revealed. We do know that when it is revealed[b] we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. 3 Everyone who has this hope based on him makes himself pure, as he is pure. 4 Avoiding Sin. Everyone who commits sin commits lawlessness, for sin is lawlessness.[c] 5 You know that he was revealed to take away sins, and in him there is no sin. 6 No one who remains in him sins; no one who sins has seen him or known him. 7 Children, let no one deceive you. The person who acts in righteousness is righteous, just as he is righteous. 8 Whoever sins belongs to the devil, because the devil has sinned from the beginning. Indeed, the Son of God was revealed to destroy the works of the devil. 9 No one who is begotten by God commits sin, because Gods seed remains in him; he cannot sin because he is begotten by God.[d] 10 In this way, the children of God and the children of the devil are made plain; no one who fails to act in righteousness belongs to God, nor anyone who does not love his brother. 11 [e]For this is the message you have heard from the beginning: we should love one another, 12 unlike Cain who belonged to the evil one and slaughtered his brother. Why did he slaughter him? Because his own works were evil, and those of his brother righteous. 13 Do not be amazed, [then,] brothers, if the world hates you. 14 We know that we have passed from death to life because we love our brothers. Whoever does not love remains in death. 15 Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him. 16 The way we came to know love was that he laid down his life for us; so we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers. 17 If someone who has worldly means sees a brother in need and refuses him compassion, how can the love of God remain in him? 18 Children, let us love not in word or speech but in deed and truth. Confidence Before God.[f] 19 [Now] this is how we shall know that we[g] belong to the truth and reassure our hearts before him 20 in whatever our hearts condemn, for God is greater than our hearts and knows everything. 21 Beloved, if [our] hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence in God 22 and receive from him whatever we ask, because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him. 23 And his commandment is this: we should believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another just as he commanded us. 24 Those who keep his commandments remain in him, and he in them, and the way we know that he remains in us is from the Spirit that he gave us. "
New American Bible (Revised Edition),NABRE,1 John,5,Chapter 5,"1 Faith Is Victory over the World. [a]Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is begotten by God, and everyone who loves the father loves [also] the one begotten by him. 2 In this way we know that we love the children of God when we love God and obey his commandments. 3 For the love of God is this, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome, 4 for whoever is begotten by God conquers the world. And the victory that conquers the world is our faith. 5 Who [indeed] is the victor over the world but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? 6 This is the one who came through water and blood,[b] Jesus Christ, not by water alone, but by water and blood. The Spirit is the one that testifies, and the Spirit is truth. 7 So there are three that testify, 8 the Spirit, the water, and the blood, and the three are of one accord. 9 If we accept human testimony, the testimony of God is surely greater. Now the testimony of God is this, that he has testified on behalf of his Son. 10 Whoever believes in the Son of God has this testimony within himself. Whoever does not believe God has made him a liar by not believing the testimony God has given about his Son. 11 And this is the testimony: God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12 Whoever possesses the Son has life; whoever does not possess the Son of God does not have life. 13 Prayer for Sinners. I write these things to you so that you may know that you have eternal life, you who believe in the name of the Son of God. 14 And we have this confidence in him, that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. 15 And if we know that he hears us in regard to whatever we ask, we know that what we have asked him for is ours. 16 If anyone sees his brother sinning, if the sin is not deadly, he should pray to God and he will give him life. This is only for those whose sin is not deadly. There is such a thing as deadly sin, about which I do not say that you should pray. 17 All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that is not deadly. 18 We know that no one begotten by God sins; but the one begotten by God he protects, and the evil one cannot touch him. 19 We know that we belong to God, and the whole world is under the power of the evil one. 20 We also know that the Son of God has come and has given us discernment to know the one who is true. And we are in the one who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life. 21 Children, be on your guard against idols. "
New American Bible (Revised Edition),NABRE,1 John,1,Chapter 1,"1 What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we looked upon and touched with our hands concerns the Word of life 2 for the life was made visible; we have seen it and testify to it and proclaim to you the eternal life that was with the Father and was made visible to us 3 what we have seen and heard we proclaim now to you, so that you too may have fellowship with us; for our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. 4 We are writing this so that our joy may be complete. 5 God Is Light. Now this is the message that we have heard from him and proclaim to you: God is light,[b] and in him there is no darkness at all. 6 If we say, We have fellowship with him, while we continue to walk in darkness, we lie and do not act in truth. 7 But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, then we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of his Son Jesus cleanses us from all sin. 8 If we say, We are without sin, we deceive ourselves,[c] and the truth is not in us. 9 If we acknowledge our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive our sins and cleanse us from every wrongdoing. 10 If we say, We have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.

Names of God Bible,NOG,1 John,2,Those Who Know Christ Obey His Commandments,"My dear children, Im writing this to you so that you will not sin. Yet, if anyone does sin, we have Yeshua Christ, who has Gods full approval. He speaks on our behalf when we come into the presence of the Father. 2 He is the payment for our sins, and not only for our sins, but also for the sins of the whole world. 3 We are sure that we know Christ if we obey his commandments. 4 The person who says, I know him, but doesnt obey his commandments is a liar. The truth isnt in that person. 5 But whoever obeys what Christ says is the kind of person in whom Gods love is perfected. Thats how we know we are in Christ. 6 Those who say that they live in him must live the same way he lived. 7 Dear friends, its not as though Im writing to give you a new commandment. Rather, Im giving you an old commandment that youve had from the beginning. Its the old commandment youve already heard. 8 On the other hand, Im writing to give you a new commandment. Its a truth that exists in Christ and in you: The darkness is fading, and the true light is already shining. 9 Those who say that they are in the light but hate other believers are still in the dark. 10 Those who love other believers live in the light. Nothing will destroy the faith of those who live in the light. 11 Those who hate other believers are in the dark and live in the dark. They dont know where theyre going, because they cant see in the dark. 12 Im writing to you, dear children, because your sins are forgiven through Christ. 13 Im writing to you, fathers, because you know Christ who has existed from the beginning. Im writing to you, young people, because you have won the victory over the evil one. 14 Ive written to you, children, because you know the Father. Ive written to you, fathers, because you know Christ, who has existed from the beginning. Ive written to you, young people, because you are strong and Gods word lives in you. You have won the victory over the evil one. 15 Dont love the world and what it offers. Those who love the world dont have the Fathers love in them. 16 Not everything that the world offersphysical gratification, greed, and extravagant lifestylescomes from the Father. It comes from the world, and 17 the world and its evil desires are passing away. But the person who does what God wants lives forever. 18 Children, its the end of time. Youve heard that an antichrist is coming. Certainly, many antichrists are already here. Thats how we know its the end of time. 19 They left us. However, they were never really part of us. If they had been, they would have stayed with us. But by leaving they made it clear that none of them were part of us. 20 The Holy One has anointed you, so all of you have knowledge. 21 Im writing to you because you know the truth, not because you dont know the truth. You know that no lie ever comes from the truth. 22 Who is a liar? Who else but the person who rejects Yeshua as the Messiah? The person who rejects the Father and the Son is an antichrist. 23 Everyone who rejects the Son doesnt have the Father either. The person who acknowledges the Son also has the Father. 24 Make sure that the message you heard from the beginning lives in you. If that message lives in you, you will also live in the Son and in the Father. 25 Christ has given us the promise of eternal life. 26 Im writing to you about those who are trying to deceive you. 27 The anointing you received from Christ lives in you. You dont need anyone to teach you something else. Instead, Christs anointing teaches you about everything. His anointing is true and contains no lie. So live in Christ as he taught you to do. 28 Now, dear children, live in Christ. Then, when he appears we will have confidence, and when he comes we wont turn from him in shame. 29 If you know that Christ has Gods approval, you also know that everyone who does what God approves of has been born from God.

New American Bible (Revised Edition),NABRE,1 John,2,Chapter 2,"1 Christ and His Commandments. My children,[a] I am writing this to you so that you may not commit sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous one. 2 He is expiation for our sins, and not for our sins only but for those of the whole world. 3 The way we may be sure[b] that we know him is to keep his commandments. 4 Whoever says, I know him, but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 5 But whoever keeps his word, the love of God is truly perfected in him. This is the way we may know that we are in union with him: 6 whoever claims to abide in him ought to live [just] as he lived. The New Commandment.[c] 7 Beloved, I am writing no new commandment to you but an old commandment that you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word that you have heard. 8 And yet I do write a new commandment to you, which holds true in him and among you,[d] for the darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining. 9 Whoever says he is in the light, yet hates his brother, is still in the darkness. 10 Whoever loves his brother remains in the light, and there is nothing in him to cause a fall. 11 Whoever hates his brother is in darkness; he walks in darkness and does not know where he is going because the darkness has blinded his eyes. Members of the Community.[e] 12 I am writing to you, children, because your sins have been forgiven for his names sake.[f] 13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have conquered the evil one. 14 I write to you, children, because you know the Father. I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong and the word of God remains in you, and you have conquered the evil one. 15 Do not love the world or the things of the world.[g] If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in the world, sensual lust,[h] enticement for the eyes, and a pretentious life, is not from the Father but is from the world. 17 Yet the world and its enticement are passing away. But whoever does the will of God remains forever. 18 Antichrists. Children, it is the last hour;[i] and just as you heard that the antichrist was coming, so now many antichrists have appeared. Thus we know this is the last hour. 19 They went out from us, but they were not really of our number;[j] if they had been, they would have remained with us. Their desertion shows that none of them was of our number. 20 But you have the anointing that comes from the holy one,[k] and you all have knowledge. 21 I write to you not because you do not know the truth but because you do, and because every lie is alien to the truth. 22 [l]Who is the liar? Whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ. Whoever denies the Father and the Son, this is the antichrist. 23 No one who denies the Son has the Father, but whoever confesses the Son has the Father as well. 24 Life from Gods Anointing. Let what you heard from the beginning remain in you. If what you heard from the beginning remains in you, then you will remain in the Son and in the Father.[m] 25 And this is the promise that he made us: eternal life. 26 I write you these things about those who would deceive you. 27 As for you, the anointing that you received from him remains in you, so that you do not need anyone to teach you. But his anointing teaches you about everything and is true and not false; just as it taught you, remain in him. 28 Children of God. [n]And now, children, remain in him, so that when he appears we may have confidence and not be put to shame by him at his coming. 29 If you consider that he is righteous, you also know that everyone who acts in righteousness is begotten by him.

Names of God Bible,NOG,1 John,1,Johns Reason for Writing,"The Word of life existed from the beginning. We have heard it. We have seen it. We observed and touched it. 2 This life was revealed to us. We have seen it, and we testify about it. We are reporting to you about this eternal life that was in the presence of the Father and was revealed to us. 3 This is the life we have seen and heard. We are reporting about it to you also so that you, too, can have a relationship with us. Our relationship is with the Father and with his Son Yeshua Christ. 4 We are writing this so that we can be completely filled with joy. 5 This is the message we heard from Christ and are reporting to you: God is light, and there isnt any darkness in him. 6 If we say, We have a relationship with God and yet live in the dark, were lying. We arent being truthful. 7 But if we live in the light in the same way that God is in the light, we have a relationship with each other. And the blood of his Son Yeshua cleanses us from every sin. 8 If we say, We arent sinful we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 9 God is faithful and reliable. If we confess our sins, he forgives them and cleanses us from everything weve done wrong. 10 If we say, We have never sinned, we turn God into a liar and his Word is not in us. "
Names of God Bible,NOG,1 John,3,Love One Another,"Consider this: The Father has given us his love. He loves us so much that we are actually called Gods dear children. And thats what we are. For this reason the world doesnt recognize us, and it didnt recognize him either. 2 Dear friends, now we are Gods children. What we will be isnt completely clear yet. We do know that when Christ appears we will be like him because we will see him as he is. 3 So all people who have this confidence in Christ keep themselves pure, as Christ is pure. 4 Those who live sinful lives are disobeying God. Sin is disobedience. 5 You know that Christ appeared in order to take away our sins. He isnt sinful. 6 Those who live in Christ dont go on sinning. Those who go on sinning havent seen or known Christ. 7 Dear children, dont let anyone deceive you. Whoever does what God approves of has Gods approval as Christ has Gods approval. 8 The person who lives a sinful life belongs to the devil, because the devil has been committing sin since the beginning. The reason that the Son of God appeared was to destroy what the devil does. 9 Those who have been born from God dont live sinful lives. What God has said lives in them, and they cant live sinful lives. They have been born from God. 10 This is the way Gods children are distinguished from the devils children. Everyone who doesnt do what is right or love other believers isnt Gods child. 11 The message that you have heard from the beginning is to love each other. 12 Dont be like Cain. He was a child of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did Cain murder his brother? Because the things Cain did were evil and the things his brother did had Gods approval. 13 Brothers and sisters, dont be surprised if the world hates you. 14 We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love other believers. The person who doesnt grow in love remains in death. 15 Everyone who hates another believer is a murderer, and you know that a murderer doesnt have eternal life. 16 We understand what love is when we realize that Christ gave his life for us. That means we must give our lives for other believers. 17 Now, suppose a person has enough to live on and notices another believer in need. How can Gods love be in that person if he doesnt bother to help the other believer? 18 Dear children, we must show love through actions that are sincere, not through empty words. 19 This is how we will know that we belong to the truth and how we will be reassured in his presence. 20 Whenever our conscience condemns us, we will be reassured that God is greater than our conscience and knows everything. 21 Dear friends, if our conscience doesnt condemn us, we can boldly look to God 22 and receive from him anything we ask. We receive it because we obey his commandments and do what pleases him. 23 This is his commandment: to believe in his Son, the one named Yeshua Christ, and to love each other as he commanded us. 24 Those who obey Christs commandments live in God, and God lives in them. We know that he lives in us because he has given us the Spirit. "
New American Bible (Revised Edition),NABRE,1 John,4,Chapter 4,"1 Testing the Spirits.[a] Beloved, do not trust every spirit but test the spirits to see whether they belong to God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 This is how you can know the Spirit of God: every spirit that acknowledges Jesus Christ come in the flesh belongs to God, 3 and every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus[b] does not belong to God. This is the spirit of the antichrist that, as you heard, is to come, but in fact is already in the world. 4 You belong to God, children, and you have conquered them, for the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. 5 They belong to the world; accordingly, their teaching belongs to the world, and the world listens to them. 6 We belong to God, and anyone who knows God listens to us, while anyone who does not belong to God refuses to hear us. This is how we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of deceit. 7 Gods Love and Christian Life. [c]Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God; everyone who loves is begotten by God and knows God. 8 Whoever is without love does not know God, for God is love. 9 In this way the love of God was revealed to us: God sent his only Son into the world so that we might have life through him. 10 In this is love: not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as expiation for our sins. 11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we also must love one another. 12 No one has ever seen God. Yet, if we love one another, God remains in us, and his love is brought to perfection in us. 13 [d]This is how we know that we remain in him and he in us, that he has given us of his Spirit. 14 Moreover, we have seen and testify that the Father sent his Son as savior of the world. 15 Whoever acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in him and he in God. 16 We have come to know and to believe in the love God has for us. God is love, and whoever remains in love remains in God and God in him. 17 In this is love brought to perfection among us, that we have confidence on the day of judgment because as he is, so are we in this world. 18 There is no fear in love, but perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do with punishment, and so one who fears is not yet perfect in love. 19 We love because he first loved us. 20 If anyone says, I love God, but hates his brother, he is a liar; for whoever does not love a brother whom he has seen cannot love God[e] whom he has not seen. 21 This is the commandment we have from him: whoever loves God must also love his brother. "
Names of God Bible,NOG,1 John,5,Those Who Believe in Jesus Are Gods Children,"Everyone who believes that Yeshua is the Messiah has been born from God. Everyone who loves the Father also loves his children. 2 We know that we love Gods children when we love God by obeying his commandments. 3 To love God means that we obey his commandments. Obeying his commandments isnt difficult 4 because everyone who has been born from God has won the victory over the world. Our faith is what wins the victory over the world. 5 Who wins the victory over the world? Isnt it the person who believes that Yeshua is the Son of God? 6 This Son of God is Yeshua Christ, who came by water and blood. He didnt come with water only, but with water and with blood. The Spirit is the one who verifies this, because the Spirit is the truth. 7 There are three witnesses:[a] 8 the Spirit, the water, and the blood. These three witnesses agree. 9 We accept human testimony. Gods testimony is greater because it is the testimony that he has given about his Son. 10 Those who believe in the Son of God have the testimony of God in them. Those who dont believe God have made God a liar. They havent believed the testimony that God has given about his Son. 11 This is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is found in his Son. 12 The person who has the Son has this life. The person who doesnt have the Son of God doesnt have this life. 13 Ive written this to those who believe in the Son of God so that they will know that they have eternal life. 14 We are confident that God listens to us if we ask for anything that has his approval. 15 We know that he listens to our requests. So we know that we already have what we ask him for. 16 If you see another believer committing a sin that doesnt lead to death, you should pray that God would give that person life. This is true for those who commit sins that dont lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. Im not telling you to pray about that. 17 Every kind of wrongdoing is sin, yet there are sins that dont lead to death. 18 We know that those who have been born from God dont go on sinning. Rather, the Son of God protects them, and the evil one cant harm them. 19 We know that we are from God, and that the whole world is under the control of the evil one. 20 We know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding so that we know the real God. We are in the one who is real, his Son Yeshua Christ. This Yeshua Christ is the real God and eternal life. 21 Dear children, guard yourselves from false gods. "
Names of God Bible,NOG,1 John,4,Test People Who Say They Have Gods Spirit,"Dear friends, dont believe all people who say that they have the Spirit. Instead, test them. See whether the spirit they have is from God, because there are many false prophets in the world. 2 This is how you can recognize Gods Spirit: Every person who declares that Yeshua Christ has come as a human has the Spirit that is from God. 3 But every person who doesnt declare that Yeshua Christ has come as a human has a spirit that isnt from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist that you have heard is coming. That spirit is already in the world. 4 Dear children, you belong to God. So you have won the victory over these people, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. 5 These people belong to the world. Thats why they speak the thoughts of the world, and the world listens to them. 6 We belong to God. The person who knows God listens to us. Whoever doesnt belong to God doesnt listen to us. Thats how we can tell the Spirit of truth from the spirit of lies. 7 Dear friends, we must love each other because love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born from God and knows God. 8 The person who doesnt love doesnt know God, because God is love. 9 God has shown us his love by sending his only Son into the world so that we could have life through him. 10 This is love: not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the payment for our sins. 11 Dear friends, if this is the way God loved us, we must also love each other. 12 No one has ever seen God. If we love each other, God lives in us, and his love is perfected in us. 13 We know that we live in him and he lives in us because he has given us his Spirit. 14 We have seen and testify to the fact that the Father sent his Son as the Savior of the world. 15 God lives in those who declare that Yeshua is the Son of God, and they live in God. 16 We have known and believed that God loves us. God is love. Those who live in Gods love live in God, and God lives in them. 17 Gods love has reached its goal in us. So we look ahead with confidence to the day of judgment. While we are in this world, we are exactly like him with regard to love. 18 No fear exists where his love is. Rather, perfect love gets rid of fear, because fear involves punishment. The person who lives in fear doesnt have perfect love. 19 We love because God loved us first. 20 Whoever says, I love God, but hates another believer is a liar. People who dont love other believers, whom they have seen, cant love God, whom they have not seen. 21 Christ has given us this commandment: The person who loves God must also love other believers. "

New American Standard Bible,NASB,1 John,5,Overcoming the World,"Everyone who believes that Jesus is the [a]Christ has been (B)born of God, and everyone who loves the [b]Father (C)loves the child born of Him. 2 By this we know that (E)we love the children of God, when we love God and [c]follow His commandments. 3 For this is the love of God, that we (G)keep His commandments; and (H)His commandments are not burdensome. 4 For [d]whoever has been born of God (J)overcomes the world; and this is the victory that has overcome the world: our faith. 5 Who is the one who overcomes the world, but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? 6 This is the One who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not [e]with the water only, but [f]with the water and [g]with the blood. It is (M)the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. 7 For there are three that testify: 8 [h]the Spirit and the water and the blood; and the three are [i]in agreement. 9 If we receive the testimony of people, the testimony of God is greater; for the testimony of God is this, that (P)He has testified concerning His Son. 10 The one who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself; the one who does not believe God has (R)made Him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning His Son. 11 And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life, and (T)this life is in His Son. 12 The one who has the Son has the life; the one who does not have the Son of God does not have the life. 13 These things I have written to you who (W)believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have (X)eternal life. 14 This is the confidence which we have [j]before Him, that, (Z)if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. 15 And if we know that He hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests which we have asked from Him. 16 If anyone sees his brother or sister [k]committing a sin not leading to death, he shall ask and [l]God will, for him, give life to those who commit sin not leading to death. (AC)There is sin leading to death; (AD)I am not saying that he should ask about that. 17 All unrighteousness is sin, and (AF)there is sin not leading to death. 18 We know that (AH)no one who has been born of God [m]sins; but He who was born of God (AI)keeps him, and (AJ)the evil one does not (AK)touch him. 19 We know that (AM)we are of God, and that (AN)the whole world lies in the power of the evil one. 20 And we know that (AP)the Son of God has come, and has (AQ)given us understanding so that we may know (AR)Him who is true; and we (AS)are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. (AT)This is the true God and (AU)eternal life. 21 Little children, guard yourselves from (AW)idols. "
New American Standard Bible,NASB,1 John,4,Testing the Spirits,"Beloved, do not believe every (B)spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because (C)many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that (E)confesses that (F)Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God; 3 and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God; this is the spirit of the (H)antichrist, which you have heard is coming, and (I)now it is already in the world. 4 You are from God, little children, and (K)have overcome them; because (L)greater is He who is in you than (M)he who is in the world. 5 They are from the world, therefore they speak as from the world, and the world listens to them. 6 We are from God. (P)The one who knows God listens to us; (Q)the one who is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know (R)the spirit of truth and (S)the spirit of error. 7 Beloved, lets (U)love one another; for love is from God, and (V)everyone who loves has been (W)born of God and (X)knows God. 8 The one who does not love does not know God, because God is love. 9 By this the love of God was revealed [a]in us, that (AA)God has sent His only Son into the world so that we may live through Him. 10 In this is love, not that we loved God, but that (AC)He loved us and sent His Son to be (AD)the [b]propitiation for our sins. 11 Beloved, if God so loved us, (AF)we also ought to love one another. 12 No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God remains in us, and His (AH)love is perfected in us. 13 By this we know that we remain in Him and He in us, because He has given to us of His Spirit. 14 We have seen and testify that the Father has (AK)sent the Son to be the Savior of the world. 15 Whoever confesses that (AM)Jesus is the Son of God, God (AN)remains in him, and he in God. 16 We have come to know and have believed the love which God has [c](AP)for us. (AQ)God is love, and the one who (AR)remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him. 17 By this, love is perfected with us, so that we may have (AT)confidence in (AU)the day of judgment; because (AV)as He is, we also are in this world. 18 There is no fear in love, but perfect love drives out fear, because fear [d]involves punishment, and the one who fears is not (AX)perfected in love. 19 We love, because He first loved us. 20 If someone says, I love God, and yet he (BA)hates his brother or sister, he is a (BB)liar; for (BC)the one who does not love his brother and sister whom he has seen, (BD)cannot love God, whom he has not seen. 21 And this commandment we have from Him, that the one who loves God (BF)must also love his brother and sister. "
New American Standard Bible,NASB,1 John,3,Children of God Love One Another,"See [a]how great a love the Father has given us, that we would be called (B)children of God; and in fact we are. For this reason the world does not know us: because (C)it did not know Him. 2 Beloved, now we are (E)children of God, and (F)it has not appeared as yet what we will be. We know that when He (G)appears, we will be (H)like Him, because we will (I)see Him just as He is. 3 And everyone who has this hope set on Him (K)purifies himself, just as He is pure. 4 Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness. 5 You know that He appeared in order to (N)take away sins; and (O)in Him there is no sin. 6 No one who remains in Him sins continually; no one who sins continually has seen Him or [b](Q)knows Him. 7 Little children, make sure no one (S)deceives you; (T)the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous; 8 the one who practices sin is of the devil; for the devil [c]has been sinning from the beginning. (V)The Son of God (W)appeared for this purpose, (X)to destroy the works of the devil. 9 No one who has been born of God practices sin, because His seed remains in him; and he cannot sin continually, because he has been born of God. 10 By this the children of God and the (AA)children of the devil are obvious: [d]anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor the one who (AB)does not love his (AC)brother and sister. 11 For this is the message (AE)which you have heard from the beginning, (AF)that we are to love one another; 12 not as Cain, who was of (AH)the evil one and murdered his brother. And for what reason did he murder him? Because (AI)his own deeds were evil, but his brothers were righteous. 13 Do not be surprised, brothers and sisters, if the world hates you. 14 We know that we have passed out of death into life, (AL)because we love the brothers and sisters. The one who does not love remains in death. 15 Everyone who hates his brother or sister is a murderer, and you know that (AN)no murderer has eternal life remaining in him. 16 We know love by this, that He laid down His life for us; and (AP)we ought to lay down our lives for the (AQ)brothers and sisters. 17 But whoever has worldly goods and sees his brother or sister in need, and (AS)closes his [e]heart [f]against him, (AT)how does the love of God remain in him? 18 Little children, lets not love with word or with tongue, but in deed and (AV)truth. 19 We will know by this that we are of the truth, and will set our heart at ease before Him, 20 that if our heart condemns us, that God is greater than our heart, and He knows all things. 21 Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have (AY)confidence [g]before God; 22 and whatever we ask, we receive from Him, because we (BA)keep His commandments and do (BB)the things that are pleasing in His sight. 23 This is His commandment, that we [h]believe in (BD)the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, just as (BE)He [i]commanded us. 24 The one who keeps His commandments (BG)remains in Him, and He in him. (BH)We know by this that (BI)He remains in us, by the Spirit whom He has given us. "
New Century Version,NCV,1 John,2,Jesus Is Our Helper,"My dear children, I write this letter to you so you will not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have a helper in the presence of the FatherJesus Christ, the One who does what is right. 2 He died in our place to take away our sins, and not only our sins but the sins of all people. 3 We can be sure that we know God if we obey his commands. 4 Anyone who says, I know God, but does not obey Gods commands is a liar, and the truth is not in that person. 5 But if someone obeys Gods teaching, then in that person Gods love has truly reached its goal. This is how we can be sure we are living in God: 6 Whoever says that he lives in God must live as Jesus lived. 7 My dear friends, I am not writing a new command to you but an old command you have had from the beginning. It is the teaching you have already heard. 8 But also I am writing a new command to you, and you can see its truth in Jesus and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining. 9 Anyone who says, I am in the light,[a] but hates a brother or sister, is still in the darkness. 10 Whoever loves a brother or sister lives in the light and will not cause anyone to stumble in his faith. 11 But whoever hates a brother or sister is in darkness, lives in darkness, and does not know where to go, because the darkness has made that person blind. 12 I write to you, dear children, because your sins are forgiven through Christ. 13 I write to you, fathers, because you know the One who existed from the beginning. I write to you, young people, because you have defeated the Evil One. 14 I write to you, children, because you know the Father. I write to you, fathers, because you know the One who existed from the beginning. I write to you, young people, because you are strong; the teaching of God lives in you, and you have defeated the Evil One. 15 Do not love the world or the things in the world. If you love the world, the love of the Father is not in you. 16 These are the ways of the world: wanting to please our sinful selves, wanting the sinful things we see, and being too proud of what we have. None of these come from the Father, but all of them come from the world. 17 The world and everything that people want in it are passing away, but the person who does what God wants lives forever. 18 My dear children, these are the last days. You have heard that the enemy of Christ is coming, and now many enemies of Christ are already here. This is how we know that these are the last days. 19 These enemies of Christ were in our fellowship, but they left us. They never really belonged to us; if they had been a part of us, they would have stayed with us. But they left, and this shows that none of them really belonged to us. 20 You have the gift[b] that the Holy One gave you, so you all know the truth.[c] 21 I do not write to you because you do not know the truth but because you do know the truth. And you know that no lie comes from the truth. 22 Who is the liar? It is the person who does not accept Jesus as the Christ. This is the enemy of Christ: the person who does not accept the Father and his Son. 23 Whoever does not accept the Son does not have the Father. But whoever confesses the Son has the Father, too. 24 Be sure you continue to follow the teaching you heard from the beginning. If you continue to follow what you heard from the beginning, you will stay in the Son and in the Father. 25 And this is what the Son promised to uslife forever. 26 I am writing this letter about those people who are trying to lead you the wrong way. 27 Christ gave you a special gift that is still in you, so you do not need any other teacher. His gift teaches you about everything, and it is true, not false. So continue to live in Christ, as his gift taught you. 28 Yes, my dear children, live in him so that when Christ comes back, we can be without fear and not be ashamed in his presence. 29 Since you know that Christ is righteous, you know that all who do right are Gods children. "
New Century Version,NCV,1 John,1,God Forgives Our Sins,"We write you now about what has always existed, which we have heard, we have seen with our own eyes, we have looked at, and we have touched with our hands. We write to you about the Word[a] that gives life. 2 He who gives life was shown to us. We saw him and can give proof about it. And now we announce to you that he has life that continues forever. He was with God the Father and was shown to us. 3 We announce to you what we have seen and heard, because we want you also to have fellowship with us. Our fellowship is with God the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. 4 We write this to you so we may be full of joy.[b] 5 Here is the message we have heard from Christ and now announce to you: God is light,[c] and in him there is no darkness at all. 6 So if we say we have fellowship with God, but we continue living in darkness, we are liars and do not follow the truth. 7 But if we live in the light, as God is in the light, we can share fellowship with each other. Then the blood of Jesus, Gods Son, cleanses us from every sin. 8 If we say we have no sin, we are fooling ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 9 But if we confess our sins, he will forgive our sins, because we can trust God to do what is right. He will cleanse us from all the wrongs we have done. 10 If we say we have not sinned, we make God a liar, and we do not accept Gods teaching. "
New American Standard Bible 1995,NASB1995,1 John,2,Christ Is Our Advocate,"My little children, I am (B)writing these things to you so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, (C)we have an [a](D)Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; 2 and He Himself is the [b]propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also (F)for those of the whole world. 3 By this we know that we have come to (H)know Him, if we (I)keep His commandments. 4 The one who says, I have come to (K)know Him, and does not keep His commandments, is a (L)liar, and (M)the truth is not in him; 5 but whoever keeps His word, in him the (O)love of God has truly been perfected. (P)By this we know that we are in Him: 6 the one who says he abides in Him (R)ought himself to walk in the same manner as He walked. 7 Beloved, I am (T)not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had (U)from the beginning; the old commandment is the word which you have heard. 8 [c]On the other hand, I am writing a new commandment to you, which is true in Him and in you, because (W)the darkness is passing away and (X)the true Light is already shining. 9 The one who says he is in the Light and yet hates his (Z)brother is in the darkness until now. 10 The one who loves his brother abides in the Light and there is no cause for stumbling in him. 11 But the one who hates his brother is in the darkness and (AC)walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going because the darkness has (AD)blinded his eyes. 12 I am writing to you, little children, because (AF)your sins have been forgiven you for His names sake. 13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you know Him who has been from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because (AH)you have overcome (AI)the evil one. I have written to you, children, because (AJ)you know the Father. 14 I have written to you, fathers, because you know Him who has been from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are (AL)strong, and the (AM)word of God abides in you, and (AN)you have overcome the evil one. 15 Do not love the world nor the things in the world. (AP)If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and (AR)the lust of the eyes and (AS)the boastful pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world. 17 The world is passing away, and also its lusts; but the one who (AU)does the will of God lives forever. 18 Children, it is the last hour; and just as you heard that (AW)antichrist is coming, (AX)even now many antichrists have appeared; from this we know that it is the last hour. 19 They went out from us, but they were not really of us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but they went out, (AZ)so that [d]it would be shown that they all are not of us. 20 [e]But you have an anointing from (BB)the Holy One, and (BC)you all know. 21 I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it, and [f]because no lie is (BE)of the truth. 22 Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the [g]Christ? This is (BG)the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son. 23 Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father; the one who confesses the Son has the Father also. 24 As for you, let that abide in you which you heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also (BJ)will abide in the Son and in the Father. 25 This is the promise which He Himself [h]made to us: eternal life. 26 These things I have written to you concerning those who are trying to deceive you. 27 As for you, the anointing which you received from Him abides in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you; but as His anointing (BN)teaches you about all things, and is (BO)true and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, [i]you abide in Him. 28 Now, little children, abide in Him, so that when He (BQ)appears, we may have (BR)confidence and (BS)not [j]shrink away from Him in shame [k]at His (BT)coming. 29 If you know that He is righteous, you know that everyone also who practices righteousness (BV)is [l]born of Him.

New American Standard Bible 1995,NASB1995,1 John,3,Children of God Love One Another,"See [a]how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we would be called (B)children of God; and such we are. For this reason the world does not know us, because (C)it did not know Him. 2 Beloved, now we are (E)children of God, and (F)it has not appeared as yet what we will be. We know that when He (G)appears, we will be (H)like Him, because we will (I)see Him just as He is. 3 And everyone who has this hope fixed on Him (K)purifies himself, just as He is pure. 4 Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness. 5 You know that He appeared in order to (N)take away sins; and (O)in Him there is no sin. 6 No one who abides in Him sins; no one who sins has seen Him or [b](Q)knows Him. 7 Little children, make sure no one (S)deceives you; (T)the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous; 8 the one who practices sin is of the devil; for the devil [c]has sinned from the beginning. (V)The Son of God (W)appeared for this purpose, (X)to destroy the works of the devil. 9 No one who is [d]born of God (Z)practices sin, because His seed abides in him; and he cannot sin, because he is [e]born of God. 10 By this the children of God and the (AB)children of the devil are obvious: [f]anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor the one who (AC)does not love his (AD)brother. 11 For this is the message (AF)which you have heard from the beginning, (AG)that we should love one another; 12 not as Cain, who was of (AI)the evil one and slew his brother. And for what reason did he slay him? Because (AJ)his deeds were evil, and his brothers were righteous. 13 Do not be surprised, brethren, if the world hates you. 14 We know that we have passed out of death into life, (AM)because we love the brethren. He who does not love abides in death. 15 Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer; and you know that (AO)no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. 16 We know love by this, that He laid down His life for us; and (AQ)we ought to lay down our lives for the (AR)brethren. 17 But whoever has the worlds goods, and sees his brother in need and (AT)closes his [g]heart [h]against him, (AU)how does the love of God abide in him? 18 Little children, let us not love with word or with tongue, but in deed and (AW)truth. 19 We will know by this that we are of the truth, and will [i]assure our heart before Him 20 [j]in whatever our heart condemns us; for God is greater than our heart and knows all things. 21 Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have (AZ)confidence [k]before God; 22 and whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we (BB)keep His commandments and do (BC)the things that are pleasing in His sight. 23 This is His commandment, that we [l]believe in (BE)the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, just as (BF)He [m]commanded us. 24 The one who keeps His commandments (BH)abides in Him, and He in him.

New Catholic Bible,NCB,1 John,2,Chapter 2,"1 My dear children, I am writing this to you so that you may avoid committing sin. However, if anyone does sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. 2 He is himself the sacrifice for our sins and not only for our sins but also for the sins of the whole world. 3 Now we may be certain that we know him if we obey his commandments. 4 Whoever says, I know him, but does not keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.[b] 5 However, the love of God is truly perfected in the one who obeys his word. This is how we can be certain that we are in union with him: 6 whoever claims to abide in him must live just as he himself lived. 7 Beloved, I am not writing a new commandment[c] for you, but an old commandment that you have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word that you have heard. 8 And yet I am writing you a new commandment, whose truth is in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining. 9 Whoever says, I am in the light, yet hates his brother, is still in the darkness. 10 Whoever loves his brother lives in the light, and there is nothing in him to make him stumble. 11 Whoever hates his brother is in the darkness, and he walks about in darkness. He does not know where he is going because the darkness has blinded him. 12 I am writing to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name. 13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you have known him who has existed from the beginning. I am writing to you, young people, because you have conquered the evil one. 14 I am writing to you, dear children, because you have known the Father. I am writing to you, fathers, because you have known him who has existed from the beginning. I am writing to you, young people, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one. 15 Do not love the world or what is in the world. If anyone does love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For everything that is in the world the concupiscence of the flesh, the concupiscence of the eyes, and the pride of life comes not from the Father but from the world.[e] 17 And the world with all its enticements is passing away, but whoever does the will of God abides forever. 18 Dear children, this is the last hour. You have heard that the Antichrist was coming, and now many antichrists have already come.[g] Thus, we know that it is the final hour. 19 They went out from us, but they never really belonged to us. If they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us. By departing from us, they made it clear that none of them belonged to us. 20 However, you have been anointed by the Holy One,[h] and you all have knowledge. 21 I write to you not because you do not know the truth but because you do know it, and because no lie can come from the truth. 22 Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? The antichrist is anyone who denies both the Father and the Son. 23 Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father, but whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. 24 Let what you heard from the beginning remain in you. If what you heard from the beginning remains in you, then you will remain in the Son and in the Father 25 And this is the promise he made to us: eternal life. 26 I write these things to you in reference to those who seek to lead you astray. 27 But as for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and therefore you do not need anyone to teach you. This same anointing teaches you everything and is true and not false, so abide in him just as he taught you. 28 And now, dear children, abide in him, so that when he appears we may have confidence and not be put to shame by him at his coming. 29 If you know that he is righteous, you also know that everyone whose life is righteous is born of him.

New American Standard Bible 1995,NASB1995,1 John,5,Overcoming the World,"Whoever believes that Jesus is the [a]Christ is [b](B)born of God, and whoever loves the [c]Father (C)loves the child [d]born of Him. 2 By this we know that (E)we love the children of God, when we love God and [e]observe His commandments. 3 For this is the love of God, that we (G)keep His commandments; and (H)His commandments are not burdensome. 4 For whatever is [f]born of God (J)overcomes the world; and this is the victory that has overcome the worldour faith. 5 Who is the one who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? 6 This is the One who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not [g]with the water only, but [h]with the water and [i]with the blood. It is (M)the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. 7 For there are three that testify: 8 [j]the Spirit and the water and the blood; and the three are [k]in agreement. 9 If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater; for the testimony of God is this, that (P)He has testified concerning His Son. 10 The one who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself; the one who does not believe God has (R)made Him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning His Son. 11 And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life, and (T)this life is in His Son. 12 He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life. 13 These things I have written to you who (W)believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have (X)eternal life. 14 This is the confidence which we have [l]before Him, that, (Z)if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. 15 And if we know that He hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests which we have asked from Him. 16 If anyone sees his brother [m]committing a sin not leading to death, he shall ask and [n]God will for him give life to those who commit sin not leading to death. (AC)There is a sin leading to death; (AD)I do not say that he should make request for this. 17 All unrighteousness is sin, and (AF)there is a sin not leading to death. 18 We know that (AH)no one who is [o]born of God sins; but He who was [p]born of God (AI)keeps him, and (AJ)the evil one does not (AK)touch him. 19 We know that (AM)we are of God, and that (AN)the whole world lies in the power of the evil one. 20 And we know that (AP)the Son of God has come, and has (AQ)given us understanding so that we may know (AR)Him who is true; and we (AS)are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ.

New Century Version,NCV,1 John,3,We Are Gods Children,"The Father has loved us so much that we are called children of God. And we really are his children. The reason the people in the world do not know us is that they have not known him. 2 Dear friends, now we are children of God, and we have not yet been shown what we will be in the future. But we know that when Christ comes again, we will be like him, because we will see him as he really is. 3 Christ is pure, and all who have this hope in Christ keep themselves pure like Christ. 4 The person who sins breaks Gods law. Yes, sin is living against Gods law. 5 You know that Christ came to take away sins and that there is no sin in Christ. 6 So anyone who lives in Christ does not go on sinning. Anyone who goes on sinning has never really understood Christ and has never known him. 7 Dear children, do not let anyone lead you the wrong way. Christ is righteous. So to be like Christ a person must do what is right. 8 The devil has been sinning since the beginning, so anyone who continues to sin belongs to the devil. The Son of God came for this purpose: to destroy the devils work. 9 Those who are Gods children do not continue sinning, because the new life from God remains in them. They are not able to go on sinning, because they have become children of God. 10 So we can see who Gods children are and who the devils children are: Those who do not do what is right are not Gods children, and those who do not love their brothers and sisters are not Gods children. 11 This is the teaching you have heard from the beginning: We must love each other. 12 Do not be like Cain who belonged to the Evil One and killed his brother. And why did he kill him? Because the things Cain did were evil, and the things his brother did were good. 13 Brothers and sisters, do not be surprised when the people of the world hate you. 14 We know we have left death and have come into life because we love each other. Whoever does not love is still dead. 15 Everyone who hates a brother or sister is a murderer,[a] and you know that no murderers have eternal life in them. 16 This is how we know what real love is: Jesus gave his life for us. So we should give our lives for our brothers and sisters. 17 Suppose someone has enough to live and sees a brother or sister in need, but does not help. Then Gods love is not living in that person. 18 My children, we should love people not only with words and talk, but by our actions and true caring. 19 - 20 This is the way we know that we belong to the way of truth. When our hearts make us feel guilty, we can still have peace before God. God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything. 21 My dear friends, if our hearts do not make us feel guilty, we can come without fear into Gods presence. 22 And God gives us what we ask for because we obey Gods commands and do what pleases him. 23 This is what God commands: that we believe in his Son, Jesus Christ, and that we love each other, just as he commanded. 24 The people who obey Gods commands live in God, and God lives in them. We know that God lives in us because of the Spirit God gave us. "
New English Translation,NET,1 John,2,Keeping Gods Commandments,"1 (My little children,[a] I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin.[b]) But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate[c] with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous One,[d] 2 and he himself is the atoning sacrifice[e] for our sins, and not only for our sins but also for the whole world.[f] 3 Now[g] by this we know that we have come to know God:[h] if we keep his commandments. 4 The one who says I have come to know God[i] and yet does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in such a person. 5 But whoever obeys his[j] word, truly in this person[k] the love of God has been perfected. By this we know that we are in him. 6 The one who says he resides[l] in God[m] ought himself to walk[n] just as Jesus[o] walked. 7 Dear friends, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning.[p] The old commandment is the word that you have already[q] heard. 8 On the other hand, I am writing a new commandment to you which is true in him[r] and in you, because[s] the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining.[t] 9 The one who says he is in the light but still hates[u] his fellow Christian[v] is still in the darkness. 10 The one who loves his fellow Christian[w] resides in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling in him.[x] 11 But the one who hates his fellow Christian[y] is in the darkness, walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.[z] 12 I am writing to you,[aa] little children, that[ab] your sins have been forgiven because of his[ac] name. 13 I am writing to you, fathers, that[ad] you have known him who has been from the beginning. I am writing to you, young people, that[ae] you have conquered the evil one.[af] 14 I have written to you, children, that[ag] you have known the Father.[ah] I have written to you, fathers, that[ai] you have known him who has been from the beginning. I have written to you, young people, that[aj] you are strong, and the word of God resides in you, and you have conquered the evil one. 15 Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him, 16 because all that is in the world (the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the arrogance produced by material possessions)[ak] is not from the Father, but is from the world. 17 And the world is passing away with all its desires, but the person who does the will of God remains[al] forever. 18 Children, it is the last hour, and just as you heard that the antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists[am] have appeared. We know from this that it is the last hour. 19 They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us, because if they had belonged to us, they would have remained[an] with us. But[ao] they went out from us[ap] to demonstrate[aq] that all of them do not belong to us.[ar] 20 Nevertheless you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know.[as] 21 I have not written to you that[at] you do not know the truth, but that[au] you do know it, and that[av] no lie is of the truth. 22 Who is the liar but the person who denies that Jesus is the Christ[aw] ? This one is the antichrist: the person who denies the Father and the Son. 23 Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either. The person who confesses the Son has the Father also.[ax] 24 As for you, what you have heard from the beginning must remain[ay] in you. If what you heard from the beginning remains in you, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. 25 Now this[az] is the promise that he[ba] himself made to[bb] us: eternal life.[bc] 26 These things I have written to you about those who are trying to deceive you.[bd] 27 Now as for you, the anointing[be] that you received from him[bf] resides[bg] in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you. But as his[bh] anointing teaches you about all things, it is true and is not a lie. Just as[bi] it[bj] has taught you, you reside[bk] in him. 28 And now, little children, remain[bl] in him,[bm] so that when[bn] he appears we may have confidence and not shrink away from him in shame when he comes back.[bo] 29 If you know that he is righteous, you also know[bp] that everyone who practices righteousness has been fathered[bq] by him.

New Catholic Bible,NCB,1 John,4,Chapter 4,"1 Beloved, do not trust every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God. For many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh[b] is from God, 3 and every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the Antichrist, about whose coming you have been told, and that it is already in the world. 4 Dear children, you are from God[c] and you have conquered them, for the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. 5 They are from the world; therefore, what they say is from the world, and the world listens to them. 6 We are from God. Anyone who knows God listens to us, while anyone who is not from God refuses to listen to us. This is how we can distinguish the spirit of truth from the spirit of falsehood.[d] 7 Beloved, let us love one another, because love is from God.[f] Everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. 8 Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. 9 Gods love was revealed to us in this way: God sent his only-begotten Son into the world so that we might have life through him. 10 This is what love is: not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as expiation for our sins.[g] 11 Beloved, since God loved us so much, we should love one another. 12 No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God abides in us, and his love is made complete in us. 13 This is how we can be certain that we abide in him and that he abides in us: he has given us a share in his Spirit.[h] 14 Moreover, we have seen for ourselves and can testify that the Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world. 15 God abides in anyone who acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, and that person abides in God. 16 We have come to know and to believe in the love that God has for us. God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God in him. 17 This is how love is made perfect in us, enabling us to have confidence on the Day of Judgment, because even in this world we have become like him. 18 In love there is no fear; indeed, perfect love casts out fear, because fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not yet achieved perfection in love. 19 Therefore, we love because he first loved us. 20 If someone says, I love God, but at the same time hates his brother, he is a liar. For whoever does not love the brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen. 21 This is the commandment we have received from him: whoever loves God must also love his brother. "
New Catholic Bible,NCB,1 John,5,Chapter 5,"1 Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the parent loves the one begotten of him as well. 2 This is how we know that we love the children of God: by loving God and obeying his commandments. 3 For the love of God is this: that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome, 4 for everyone born of God conquers the world. And the victory that conquers the world is our faith. 5 Who indeed conquers the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? 6 This is the one who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ not by water alone, but by water and blood. And to this the Spirit bears witness, for the Spirit is truth.[b] 7 Thus, there are three[c] witnesses, 8 the Spirit, the water, and the blood, and these three are as one.[d] 9 If we accept human testimony, the testimony of God is greater. For it is the testimony of God, the testimony that he has given about his Son. 10 Whoever believes in the Son of God has this testimony in himself, but those who do not believe in God have made him out to be a liar by refusing to believe the testimony that God has given about his Son. 11 And this is the testimony: God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12 Whoever possesses the Son possesses life; whoever does not possess the Son of God does not possess life. 13 I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life. 14 And thus we can have confidence in him that if we ask anything that is in accordance with his will, he hears us. 15 And if we know that he hears us in regard to whatever we ask him, we may be sure that all we ask of him will be ours. 16 If anyone sees a brother commit a sin that does not lead to death, he should intercede for him, and God will grant him life provided that the sin is not deadly. There is a sin that leads to death, and I do not say that you should pray about it.[h] 17 All wrongdoing is sinful, but not all sins are deadly. 18 We know that one born of God does not continue to sin, because he who is born of God protects him, and the evil one has no power over him. 19 We know that we are from God and that the entire world lies under the power of the evil one. 20 We also know that the Son of God has come and given us understanding so that we can know the one who is true. And we are in the one who is true, since we are in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life. 21 Dear children, keep away from idols. "
New Century Version,NCV,1 John,4,Warning Against False Teachers,"My dear friends, many false prophets have gone out into the world. So do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see if they are from God. 2 This is how you can know Gods Spirit: Every spirit who confesses that Jesus Christ came to earth as a human is from God. 3 And every spirit who refuses to say this about Jesus is not from God. It is the spirit of the enemy of Christ, which you have heard is coming, and now he is already in the world. 4 My dear children, you belong to God and have defeated them; because Gods Spirit, who is in you, is greater than the devil, who is in the world. 5 And they belong to the world, so what they say is from the world, and the world listens to them. 6 But we belong to God, and those who know God listen to us. But those who are not from God do not listen to us. That is how we know the Spirit that is true and the spirit that is false. 7 Dear friends, we should love each other, because love comes from God. Everyone who loves has become Gods child and knows God. 8 Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. 9 This is how God showed his love to us: He sent his one and only Son into the world so that we could have life through him. 10 This is what real love is: It is not our love for God; it is Gods love for us. He sent his Son to die in our place to take away our sins. 11 Dear friends, if God loved us that much we also should love each other. 12 No one has ever seen God, but if we love each other, God lives in us, and his love is made perfect in us. 13 We know that we live in God and he lives in us, because he gave us his Spirit. 14 We have seen and can testify that the Father sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. 15 Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God has God living inside, and that person lives in God. 16 And so we know the love that God has for us, and we trust that love. God is love. Those who live in love live in God, and God lives in them. 17 This is how love is made perfect in us: that we can be without fear on the day God judges us, because in this world we are like him. 18 Where Gods love is, there is no fear, because Gods perfect love drives out fear. It is punishment that makes a person fear, so love is not made perfect in the person who fears. 19 We love because God first loved us. 20 If people say, I love God, but hate their brothers or sisters, they are liars. Those who do not love their brothers and sisters, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have never seen. 21 And God gave us this command: Those who love God must also love their brothers and sisters. "
New Century Version,NCV,1 John,5,Faith in the Son of God,"Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is Gods child, and whoever loves the Father also loves the Fathers children. 2 This is how we know we love Gods children: when we love God and obey his commands. 3 Loving God means obeying his commands. And Gods commands are not too hard for us, 4 because everyone who is a child of God conquers the world. And this is the victory that conquers the worldour faith. 5 So the one who conquers the world is the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God. 6 Jesus Christ is the One who came by water[a] and blood.[b] He did not come by water only, but by water and blood. And the Spirit says that this is true, because the Spirit is the truth. 7 So there are three witnesses:[c] 8 the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three witnesses agree. 9 We believe people when they say something is true. But what God says is more important, and he has told us the truth about his own Son. 10 Anyone who believes in the Son of God has the truth that God told us. Anyone who does not believe makes God a liar, because that person does not believe what God told us about his Son. 11 This is what God told us: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12 Whoever has the Son has life, but whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life. 13 I write this letter to you who believe in the Son of God so you will know you have eternal life. 14 And this is the boldness we have in Gods presence: that if we ask God for anything that agrees with what he wants, he hears us. 15 If we know he hears us every time we ask him, we know we have what we ask from him. 16 If anyone sees a brother or sister sinning (sin that does not lead to eternal death), that person should pray, and God will give the sinner life. I am talking about people whose sin does not lead to eternal death. There is sin that leads to death. I do not mean that a person should pray about that sin. 17 Doing wrong is always sin, but there is sin that does not lead to eternal death. 18 We know that those who are Gods children do not continue to sin. The Son of God keeps them safe, and the Evil One cannot touch them. 19 We know that we belong to God, but the Evil One controls the whole world. 20 We also know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding so that we can know the True One. And our lives are in the True One and in his Son, Jesus Christ. He is the true God and the eternal life. 21 So, dear children, keep yourselves away from false gods. "
New Catholic Bible,NCB,1 John,3,Chapter 3,"1 See what love the Father has bestowed on us, enabling us to be called the children of God, and that is what we are. If the world does not recognize us, that is because it did not know him. 2 Beloved, we are Gods children now. What we shall be has not yet been revealed. However, we do know that when he appears we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he really is. 3 Everyone who has this hope in him keeps himself pure, just as he is pure. 4 Everyone who sins breaks the law, for sin is lawlessness. 5 You know that he appeared in order to take away sins, and that there is no sin in him. 6 Whoever remains in him does not sin,[b] and whoever sins has not seen him nor known him. 7 Dear children, do not let anyone deceive you. Everyone who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous. 8 Everyone who sins comes from the devil, for the devil has been a sinner from the very beginning. The Son of God appeared for this very purpose: to destroy the work of the devil. 9 Whoever is born of God does not sin, because his seed[c] remains in him. He cannot sin because he is begotten by God. 10 This is what distinguishes the children of God from the children of the devil: anyone who fails to live righteously does not belong to God; neither does anyone who fails to love a brother. 11 For from the beginning you have heard the message that we should love one another, 12 unlike Cain who was from the evil one and slew his brother. And why did he slay him? Because his own deeds were evil while those of his brother were righteous. 13 Do not be surprised, my brethren, if the world hates you. 14 We know that we have passed from death to life because we love our brethren. Whoever does not love remains in death. 15 Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. 16 This is how we know what love is: he laid down his life for us, and we in turn must be prepared to lay down our lives for our brethren. 17 If anyone is rich in worldly possessions and sees a brother in need but refuses to open his heart, how can the love of God abide in him? 18 Dear children, let us love not in word or speech but in deed and truth.[e] 19 This is how we know that we belong to the truth and reassure our hearts in his presence 20 even if our hearts experience a sense of guilt. For God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything. 21 Beloved, if our hearts do not condemn us, we can approach God with confidence 22 and receive from him whatever we ask, because we obey his commandments and do whatever is pleasing to him.[f] 23 And this is his commandment: that we should believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another just as he commanded us.[g] 24 All those who keep his commandments abide in him, and he abides in them. And the proof that he abides in us is the Spirit that he has given us. "
New American Standard Bible 1995,NASB1995,1 John,4,Testing the Spirits,"Beloved, do not believe every (B)spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because (C)many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that (E)confesses that (F)Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God; 3 and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God; this is the spirit of the (H)antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming, and (I)now it is already in the world. 4 You are from God, little children, and (K)have overcome them; because (L)greater is He who is in you than (M)he who is in the world. 5 They are from the world; therefore they speak as from the world, and the world listens to them. 6 We are from God; (P)he who knows God listens to us; (Q)he who is not from God does not listen to us.

For our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. 4 We are writing this so that our joy may be complete. 5 This is the message that we have heard from him and that we declare to you: God is light, and there is no darkness[f] at all in him. 6 If we claim that we have fellowship with him while we continue to live in darkness, we are lying and do not live in the truth. 7 However, if we live in the light as he himself is in the light, then we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son purifies us from all sin. 8 If we claim that we are sinless, we are only deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 9 However, if we confess our sins, he who is faithful and just will forgive our sins and cleanse us from all wrongdoing. 10 If we say that we have never sinned, we make him out to be a liar, and his word is not in us.

New International Reader's Version,NIRV,1 John,2,Instructions About Loving and Hating Other Believers,"My dear children, Im writing this to you so that you will not sin. But suppose someone does sin. Then we have a friend who speaks to the Father for us. He is Jesus Christ, the Blameless One. 2 He gave his life to pay for our sins. But he not only paid for our sins. He also paid for the sins of the whole world. 3 We know that we have come to know God if we obey his commands. 4 Suppose someone says, I know him. But suppose this person does not do what God commands. Then this person is a liar and is not telling the truth. 5 But if anyone obeys Gods word, then that person truly loves God. Here is how we know we belong to him. 6 Those who claim to belong to him must live just as Jesus did. 7 Dear friends, Im not writing you a new command. Instead, Im writing one you have heard before. You have had it since the beginning. 8 But I am writing what amounts to a new command. Its truth was shown in how Jesus lived. It is also shown in how you live. Thats because the darkness is passing away. And the true light is already shining. 9 Suppose someone claims to be in the light but hates a brother or sister. Then they are still in the darkness. 10 Anyone who loves their brother and sister lives in the light. There is nothing in them to make them fall into sin. 11 But anyone who hates a brother or sister is in the darkness. They walk around in the darkness. They dont know where they are going. The darkness has made them blind. 12 Dear children, Im writing to you because your sins have been forgiven. They have been forgiven because of what Jesus has done. 13 Fathers, Im writing to you because you know the one who is from the beginning. Young men, Im writing to you because you have won the battle over the evil one. 14 Dear children, Im writing to you because you know the Father. Fathers, Im writing to you because you know the one who is from the beginning. Young men, Im writing to you because you are strong. Gods word lives in you. You have won the battle over the evil one. 15 Do not love the world or anything in it. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in them. 16 Here is what people who belong to this world do. They try to satisfy what their sinful desires want to do. They long for what their sinful eyes look at. They take pride in what they have and what they do. All of this comes from the world. None of it comes from the Father. 17 The world and its evil desires are passing away. But whoever does what God wants them to do lives forever. 18 Dear children, we are living in the last days. You have heard that the great enemy of Christ is coming. But even now many enemies of Christ have already come. Thats how we know that these are the last days. 19 These enemies left our community of believers. They didnt really belong to us. If they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us. But by leaving they showed that none of them belonged to us. 20 You have received the Spirit from the Holy One. And all of you know the truth. 21 Im not writing to you because you dont know the truth. Im writing because you do know it. Im writing to you because no lie comes from the truth. 22 Who is the liar? It is anyone who says that Jesus is not the Christ. The person who says this is the great enemy of Christ. They say no to the Father and the Son. 23 The person who says no to the Son doesnt belong to the Father. But anyone who says yes to the Son belongs to the Father also. 24 Make sure that you dont forget what you have heard from the beginning. Then you will remain joined to the Son and to the Father. 25 And here is what God has promised us. He has promised us eternal life. 26 Im writing these things to warn you. I am warning you about people trying to lead you astray. 27 But you have received the Holy Spirit from God. He continues to live in you. So you dont need anyone to teach you. Gods Spirit teaches you about everything. What he says is true. He doesnt lie. Remain joined to Christ, just as you have been taught by the Spirit. 28 Dear children, remain joined to Christ. Then when he comes, we can be bold. We will not be ashamed to meet him when he comes. 29 You know that God is right and always does what is right. And you know that everyone who does what is right is Gods child. "
New International Reader's Version,NIRV,1 John,1,The Word of Life Became a Human Being,"Here is what we announce to everyone about the Word of life. The Word was already here from the beginning. We have heard him. We have seen him with our eyes. We have looked at him. Our hands have touched him. 2 This life has appeared. We have seen him. We are witnesses about him. And we announce to you this same eternal life. He was already with the Father. He has appeared to us. 3 We announce to you what we have seen and heard. We do it so you can share life together with us. And we share life with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. 4 We are writing this to make our joy complete. 5 Here is the message we have heard from him and announce to you. God is light. There is no darkness in him at all. 6 Suppose we say that we share life with God but still walk in the darkness. Then we are lying. We are not living out the truth. 7 But suppose we walk in the light, just as he is in the light. Then we share life with one another. And the blood of Jesus, his Son, makes us pure from all sin. 8 Suppose we claim we are without sin. Then we are fooling ourselves. The truth is not in us. 9 But God is faithful and fair. If we confess our sins, he will forgive our sins. He will forgive every wrong thing we have done. He will make us pure. 10 If we claim we have not sinned, we are calling God a liar. His word is not in us. "
New International Reader's Version,NIRV,1 John,3,More Instructions About Loving and Hating One Another,"See what amazing love the Father has given us! Because of it, we are called children of God. And thats what we really are! The world doesnt know us because it didnt know him. 2 Dear friends, now we are children of God. He still hasnt let us know what we will be. But we know that when Christ appears, we will be like him. Thats because we will see him as he really is. 3 Christ is pure. All who hope to be like him make themselves pure. 4 Everyone who sins breaks the law. In fact, breaking the law is sin. 5 But you know that Christ came to take our sins away. And there is no sin in him. 6 No one who remains joined to him keeps on sinning. No one who keeps on sinning has seen him or known him. 7 Dear children, dont let anyone lead you astray. The person who does what is right is holy, just as Christ is holy. 8 The person who does what is sinful belongs to the devil. Thats because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. But the Son of God came to destroy the devils work. 9 Those who are Gods children will not keep on sinning. Gods very nature remains in them. They cant go on sinning. Thats because they are Gods children. 10 Here is how you can tell the difference between Gods children and the devils children. Anyone who doesnt do what is right isnt Gods child. And anyone who doesnt love their brother or sister isnt Gods child either. 11 From the beginning we have heard that we should love one another. 12 Dont be like Cain. He belonged to the evil one. He murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because the things Cain had done were wrong. But the things his brother had done were right. 13 My brothers and sisters, dont be surprised if the world hates you. 14 We know that we have left our old dead way of life. And we have entered into new life. We know this because we love one another. Anyone who doesnt love still lives in their old condition. 15 Anyone who hates their brother or sister is a murderer. And you know that no murderer has eternal life. 16 We know what love is because Jesus Christ gave his life for us. So we should give our lives for our brothers and sisters. 17 Suppose someone sees a brother or sister in need and is able to help them. And suppose that person doesnt take pity on these needy people. Then how can the love of God be in that person? 18 Dear children, dont just talk about love. Put your love into action. Then it will truly be love. 19 Heres how we know that we hold to the truth. And heres how we put our hearts at rest, knowing that God is watching. 20 If our hearts judge us, we know that God is greater than our hearts. And he knows everything. 21 Dear friends, if our hearts do not judge us, we can be bold with God. 22 And he will give us anything we ask. Thats because we obey his commands. We do what pleases him. 23 God has commanded us to believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ. He has also commanded us to love one another. 24 The one who obeys Gods commands remains joined to him. And he remains joined to them. Here is how we know that God lives in us. We know it because of the Holy Spirit he gave us. "
New International Reader's Version,NIRV,1 John,4,Jesus Came as a Human Being,"Dear friends, do not believe every spirit. Test the spirits to see if they belong to God. Many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 Here is how you can recognize the Spirit of God. Every spirit agreeing that Jesus Christ came in a human body belongs to God. 3 But every spirit that doesnt agree with this does not belong to God. You have heard that the spirit of the great enemy of Christ is coming. Even now it is already in the world. 4 Dear children, you belong to God. You have not accepted the teachings of the false prophets. Thats because the one who is in you is powerful. He is more powerful than the one who is in the world. 5 False prophets belong to the world. So they speak from the worlds point of view. And the world listens to them. 6 We belong to God. And those who know God listen to us. But those who dont belong to God dont listen to us. Thats how we can tell the difference between the Spirit of truth and the spirit of lies. 7 Dear friends, let us love one another, because love comes from God. Everyone who loves has become a child of God and knows God. 8 Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love. 9 Here is how God showed his love among us. He sent his one and only Son into the world. He sent him so we could receive life through him. 10 Here is what love is. It is not that we loved God. It is that he loved us and sent his Son to give his life to pay for our sins. 11 Dear friends, since God loved us this much, we should also love one another. 12 No one has ever seen God. But if we love one another, God lives in us. His love is made complete in us. 13 Heres how we know that we are joined to him and he to us. He has given us his Holy Spirit. 14 The Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. We have seen it and are witnesses to it. 15 God lives in anyone who agrees that Jesus is the Son of God. This kind of person remains joined to God. 16 So we know that God loves us. We depend on it. God is love. Anyone who leads a life of love is joined to God. And God is joined to them. 17 Suppose love is fulfilled among us. Then we can be without fear on the day God judges the world. Love is fulfilled among us when in this world we are like Jesus. 18 There is no fear in love. Instead, perfect love drives away fear. Thats because fear has to do with being punished. The one who fears does not have perfect love. 19 We love because he loved us first. 20 Suppose someone claims to love God but hates a brother or sister. Then they are a liar. They dont love their brother or sister, whom they have seen. So they cant love God, whom they havent seen. 21 Here is the command God has given us. Anyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister. "
New English Translation,NET,1 John,5,Testimony About the Son,"1 Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ[a] has been fathered[b] by God, and everyone who loves the father[c] loves the child fathered by him.[d] 2 By this[e] we know that we love the children of God: whenever we love God and obey his commandments. 3 For[f] this is the love of God:[g] that we keep his commandments.[h] And his commandments do not weigh us down, 4 because[i] everyone[j] who has been fathered by God[k] conquers[l] the world.[m] This[n] is the conquering power[o] that has conquered[p] the world: our faith. 5 Now who is the person who has conquered the world except the one who believes that[q] Jesus is the Son of God? 6 Jesus Christ is the one who came by water and bloodnot by the water only, but by the water and the blood. And the Spirit is the one who testifies, because[r] the Spirit is the truth. 7 For[s] there are three that testify,[t] 8 the Spirit and the water and the blood, and these three are in agreement. 9 If we accept the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater, because[u] this[v] is the testimony of God that[w] he has testified concerning his Son. 10 (The one who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself; the one who does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has testified concerning his Son.)[x] 11 And this is the testimony: God[y] has given us eternal life,[z] and this life is in his Son. 12 The one who has the Son[aa] has this[ab] eternal[ac] life; the one who does not have the Son of God does not have this[ad] eternal[ae] life. 13 I have written these things[af] to you who believe[ag] in the name of the Son of God so that[ah] you may know that you have eternal life. 14 And this is the confidence that we have before him: that[ai] whenever[aj] we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. 15 And if we know[ak] that he hears us in regard to whatever we ask, then we know that we have the requests that we have asked from him. 16 If[al] anyone sees his fellow Christian[am] committing a sin not resulting in death,[an] he should ask, and God[ao] will grant[ap] life to the person who commits a sin not resulting in death.[aq] There is a sin[ar] resulting in death.[as] I do not say that he should ask about that. 17 All unrighteousness[at] is sin, but there is sin not resulting in death.[au] 18 We know that everyone fathered[av] by God does not sin, but God[aw] protects[ax] the one he has fathered, and the evil one cannot touch him. 19 We know that we are from God,[ay] and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one. 20 And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us insight to know[az] him who is true, and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This one[ba] is the true God and eternal life. 21 Little children, guard yourselves from idols.[bb] "
New International Version - UK,NIVUK,1 John,4,On denying the incarnation,"Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 This is how you can recognise the Spirit of God: every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, 3 but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world. 4 You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. 5 They are from the world and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world, and the world listens to them. 6 We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us; but whoever is not from God does not listen to us. This is how we recognise the Spirit[a] of truth and the spirit of falsehood. 7 Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. 8 Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. 9 This is how God showed his love among us: he sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 10 This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. 11 Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. 12 No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us. 13 This is how we know that we live in him and he in us: he has given us of his Spirit. 14 And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Saviour of the world. 15 If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 16 And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them. 17 This is how love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment: in this world we are like Jesus. 18 There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love. 19 We love because he first loved us. 20 Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar. For whoever does not love their brother and sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen. 21 And he has given us this command: anyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister. "
New International Version,NIV,1 John,5,Faith in the Incarnate Son of God,"Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ(B) is born of God,(C) and everyone who loves the father loves his child as well.(D) 2 This is how we know that we love the children of God:(F) by loving God and carrying out his commands. 3 In fact, this is love for God: to keep his commands. And his commands are not burdensome,(H) 4 for everyone born of God overcomes(J) the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith. 5 Who is it that overcomes the world? Only the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God. 6 This is the one who came by water and bloodJesus Christ. He did not come by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.(M) 7 For there are three that testify: 8 the[a] Spirit, the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement. 9 We accept human testimony, but Gods testimony is greater because it is the testimony of God,(P) which he has given about his Son. 10 Whoever believes in the Son of God accepts this testimony. Whoever does not believe God has made him out to be a liar,(R) because they have not believed the testimony God has given about his Son. 11 And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.(T) 12 Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life. 13 I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.(W) 14 This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.(Y) 15 And if we know that he hears uswhatever we askwe know that we have what we asked of him.(AA) 16 If you see any brother or sister commit a sin that does not lead to death, you should pray and God will give them life. I refer to those whose sin does not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death.(AC) I am not saying that you should pray about that.(AD) 17 All wrongdoing is sin, and there is sin that does not lead to death.(AF) 18 We know that anyone born of God does not continue to sin; the One who was born of God keeps them safe, and the evil one(AH) cannot harm them.(AI) 19 We know that we are children of God, and that the whole world is under the control of the evil one.(AK) 20 We know also that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding,(AM) so that we may know him who is true.(AN) And we are in him who is true by being in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.(AO) 21 Dear children, keep yourselves from idols.(AQ) "
New International Version - UK,NIVUK,1 John,3,More on love and hatred,"See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him. 2 Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when Christ appears,[a] we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. 3 All who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is pure. 4 Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness. 5 But you know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins. And in him is no sin. 6 No one who lives in him keeps on sinning. No one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him. 7 Dear children, do not let anyone lead you astray. The one who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous. 8 The one who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devils work. 9 No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because Gods seed remains in them; they cannot go on sinning, because they have been born of God. 10 This is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the devil are: anyone who does not do what is right is not Gods child, nor is anyone who does not love their brother and sister. 11 For this is the message you heard from the beginning: we should love one another. 12 Do not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own actions were evil and his brothers were righteous. 13 Do not be surprised, my brothers and sisters,[b] if the world hates you. 14 We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love each other. Anyone who does not love remains in death. 15 Anyone who hates a brother or sister is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in him. 16 This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters. 17 If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person? 18 Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth. 19 This is how we know that we belong to the truth and how we set our hearts at rest in his presence: 20 if our hearts condemn us, we know that God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything. 21 Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God 22 and receive from him anything we ask, because we keep his commands and do what pleases him. 23 And this is his command: to believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another as he commanded us. 24 The one who keeps Gods commands lives in him, and he in them. And this is how we know that he lives in us: we know it by the Spirit he gave us. "
New International Version,NIV,1 John,2,Love and Hatred for Fellow Believers,"My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have an advocate(B) with the FatherJesus Christ, the Righteous One. 2 He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.(D) 3 We know that we have come to know him(F) if we keep his commands.(G) 4 Whoever says, I know him, but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in that person.(I) 5 But if anyone obeys his word, love for God[a] is truly made complete in them.(K) This is how we know(L) we are in him: 6 Whoever claims to live in him must live as Jesus did. 7 Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old one, which you have had since the beginning.(O) This old command is the message you have heard. 8 Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and in you, because the darkness is passing(Q) and the true light(R) is already shining.(S) 9 Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates a brother or sister[b] is still in the darkness.(U) 10 Anyone who loves their brother and sister[c] lives in the light, and there is nothing in them to make them stumble.(W) 11 But anyone who hates a brother or sister is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness.(Y) They do not know where they are going, because the darkness has blinded them.(Z) 12 I am writing to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name. 13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one.(AE) 14 I write to you, dear children, because you know the Father. I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you,(AJ) and you have overcome the evil one. 15 Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father[d] is not in them.(AM) 16 For everything in the worldthe lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes,(AO) and the pride of lifecomes not from the Father but from the world. 17 The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God(AQ) lives forever. 18 Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming,(AS) even now many antichrists have come.(AT) This is how we know it is the last hour. 19 They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us.(AV) 20 But you have an anointing from the Holy One,(AX) and all of you know the truth.[e](AY) 21 I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth. 22 Who is the liar? It is whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a person is the antichristdenying the Father and the Son. 23 No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. 24 As for you, see that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father.(BD) 25 And this is what he promised useternal life. 26 I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray. 27 As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things(BH) and as that anointing is real, not counterfeitjust as it has taught you, remain in him.(BI) 28 And now, dear children, continue in him, so that when he appears(BK) we may be confident(BL) and unashamed before him at his coming.(BM) 29 If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him.(BO) "
New International Version - UK,NIVUK,1 John,1,The incarnation of the Word of life,"That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched this we proclaim concerning the Word of life. 2 The life appeared; we have seen it and testify to it, and we proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and has appeared to us. 3 We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. 4 We write this to make our[a] joy complete. 5 This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light; in him there is no darkness at all. 6 If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live out the truth. 7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all[b] sin. 8 If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. 9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. 10 If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us.

New King James Version,NKJV,1 John,2,The Test of Knowing Christ,"My little children, these things I write to you, so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. 2 And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but (C)also for the whole world. 3 Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. 4 He who says, I know Him, and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 5 But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God [a]is perfected (F)in him. By this we know that we are in Him. 6 He who says he abides in Him (H)ought himself also to walk just as He walked. 7 [b]Brethren, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you heard [c]from the beginning. 8 Again, a new commandment I write to you, which thing is true in Him and in you, (K)because the darkness is passing away, and (L)the true light is already shining. 9 He who says he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness until now. 10 He who loves his brother abides in the light, and (O)there is no cause for stumbling in him. 11 But he who hates his brother is in darkness and (Q)walks in darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes. 12 I write to you, little children, Because your sins are forgiven you for His names sake. 13 I write to you, fathers, Because you have known Him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, Because you have overcome the wicked one. I write to you, little children, Because you have known the Father. 14 I have written to you, fathers, Because you have known Him who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, Because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, And you have overcome the wicked one. 15 Do not love the world or the things in the world. (W)If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in the worldthe lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of lifeis not of the Father but is of the world. 17 And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever. 18 Little children, (AA)it is the last hour; and as you have heard that (AB)the[d] Antichrist is coming, (AC)even now many antichrists have come, by which we know (AD)that it is the last hour. 19 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for (AF)if they had been of us, they would have continued with us; but they went out (AG)that they might be made manifest, that none of them were of us. 20 But you have an anointing (AI)from the Holy One, and (AJ)you[e] know all things. 21 I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth. 22 Who is a liar but he who denies that (AL)Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist who denies the Father and the Son. 23 Whoever denies the Son does not have the (AN)Father either; (AO)he who acknowledges the Son has the Father also. 24 Therefore let that abide in you which you heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, (AQ)you also will abide in the Son and in the Father. 25 And this is the promise that He has promised useternal life. 26 These things I have written to you concerning those who try to [f]deceive you. 27 But the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and (AT)you do not need that anyone teach you; but as the same anointing (AU)teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you [g]will abide in Him. 28 And now, little children, abide in Him, that [h]when He appears, we may have confidence and not be ashamed before Him at His coming. 29 If you know that He is righteous, you know that (AX)everyone who practices righteousness is born of Him. "
New International Version,NIV,1 John,4,On Denying the Incarnation,"Dear friends, do not believe every spirit,(B) but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.(C) 2 This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,(E) 3 but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.(G) 4 You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them,(I) because the one who is in you(J) is greater than the one who is in the world.(K) 5 They are from the world and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world, and the world listens to them. 6 We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us; but whoever is not from God does not listen to us. This is how we recognize the Spirit[a] of truth(N) and the spirit of falsehood.(O) 7 Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God(Q) and knows God.(R) 8 Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. 9 This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him.(U) 10 This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.(W) 11 Dear friends, since God so loved us,(Y) we also ought to love one another.(Z) 12 No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us.(AB) 13 This is how we know that we live in him and he in us: He has given us of his Spirit.(AD) 14 And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world.(AF) 15 If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God.(AH) 16 And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them.(AJ) 17 This is how love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence(AL) on the day of judgment:(AM) In this world we are like Jesus. 18 There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love. 19 We love because he first loved us. 20 Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar.(AQ) For whoever does not love their brother and sister, whom they have seen,(AR) cannot love God, whom they have not seen.(AS) 21 And he has given us this command: Anyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister.(AU) "
New International Version - UK,NIVUK,1 John,2,Love and hatred for fellow believers,"My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. 2 He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world. 3 We know that we have come to know him if we keep his commands. 4 Whoever says, I know him, but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in that person. 5 But if anyone obeys his word, love for God[a] is truly made complete in them. This is how we know we are in him: 6 whoever claims to live in him must live as Jesus did. 7 Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old one, which you have had since the beginning. This old command is the message you have heard. 8 Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and in you, because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining. 9 Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates a brother or sister[b] is still in the darkness. 10 Anyone who loves their brother and sister[c] lives in the light, and there is nothing in them to make them stumble. 11 But anyone who hates a brother or sister is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness. They do not know where they are going, because the darkness has blinded them. 12 I am writing to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name. 13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. 14 I write to you, dear children, because you know the Father. I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you, and you have overcome the evil one. 15 Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father[d] is not in them. 16 For everything in the world the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life comes not from the Father but from the world. 17 The world and its desires pass away, but whoever does the will of God lives for ever. 18 Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour. 19 They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us. 20 But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth.[e] 21 I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth. 22 Who is the liar? It is whoever denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a person is the antichrist denying the Father and the Son. 23 No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also. 24 As for you, see that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father. 25 And this is what he promised us eternal life. 26 I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray. 27 As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit just as it has taught you, remain in him. 28 And now, dear children, continue in him, so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming. 29 If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him.

And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.(H) 4 We write this to make our[a] joy complete.(J) 5 This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light;(L) in him there is no darkness at all. 6 If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live out the truth.(N) 7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all[b] sin.(P) 8 If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.(R) 9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.(T) 10 If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar(V) and his word is not in us.(W) "

New International Version - UK,NIVUK,1 John,5,Faith in the incarnate Son of God,"Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the father loves his child as well. 2 This is how we know that we love the children of God: by loving God and carrying out his commands. 3 In fact, this is love for God: to keep his commands. And his commands are not burdensome, 4 for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith. 5 Who is it that overcomes the world? Only the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God. 6 This is the one who came by water and blood Jesus Christ. He did not come by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. 7 For there are three that testify: 8 the[a] Spirit, the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement. 9 We accept human testimony, but Gods testimony is greater because it is the testimony of God, which he has given about his Son. 10 Whoever believes in the Son of God accepts this testimony. Whoever does not believe God has made him out to be a liar, because they have not believed the testimony God has given about his Son. 11 And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12 Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life. 13 I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life. 14 This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. 15 And if we know that he hears us whatever we ask we know that we have what we asked of him. 16 If you see any brother or sister commit a sin that does not lead to death, you should pray and God will give them life. I refer to those whose sin does not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I am not saying that you should pray about that. 17 All wrongdoing is sin, and there is sin that does not lead to death. 18 We know that anyone born of God does not continue to sin; the One who was born of God keeps them safe, and the evil one cannot harm them. 19 We know that we are children of God, and that the whole world is under the control of the evil one. 20 We know also that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true. And we are in him who is true by being in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life. 21 Dear children, keep yourselves from idols. "
New King James Version,NKJV,1 John,5,Obedience by Faith,"Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is (B)born of God, and everyone who loves Him who begot also loves him who is begotten of Him. 2 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep His commandments. 3 For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments. And (E)His commandments are not burdensome. 4 For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that (G)has overcome the world[a]our faith. 5 Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? 6 This is He who came by water and bloodJesus Christ; not only by water, but by water and blood. (J)And it is the Spirit who bears witness, because the Spirit is truth. 7 For there are three that bear witness [b]in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; (L)and these three are one. 8 And there are three that bear witness on earth: the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three agree as one. 9 If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater; (O)for this is the witness of [c]God which He has testified of His Son. 10 He who believes in the Son of God has the witness in himself; he who does not believe God (Q)has made Him a liar, because he has not believed the testimony that God has given of His Son. 11 And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. 12 He who has the Son has [d]life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life. 13 These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, [e]and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God. 14 Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. 15 And if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we have asked of Him. 16 If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin which does not lead to death, he will ask, and He will give him life for those who commit sin not leading to death. (U)There is sin leading to death. (V)I do not say that he should pray about that. 17 All unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin not leading to death. 18 We know that whoever is born of God does not sin; but he who has been born of God (Y)keeps[f] [g]himself, and the wicked one does not touch him. 19 We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies under the sway of the wicked one. 20 And we know that the Son of God has come and (AB)has given us an understanding, (AC)that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. (AD)This is the true God (AE)and eternal life. 21 Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen. "
New King James Version,NKJV,1 John,4,Love for God and One Another,"Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God; because (B)many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 By this you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God, 3 and every spirit that does not confess [a]that Jesus [b]Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. And this is the spirit of the Antichrist, which you have heard was coming, and is now already in the world. 4 You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world. 5 They are of the world. Therefore they speak as of the world, and (F)the world hears them. 6 We are of God. He who knows God hears us; he who is not of God does not hear us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error. 7 Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who (J)loves is born of God and knows God. 8 He who does not love does not know God, for God is love. 9 In this the love of God was manifested toward us, that God has sent His only begotten (L)Son into the world, that we might live through Him. 10 In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son (N)to be the propitiation for our sins. 11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. 12 No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abides in us, and His love has been perfected in us. 13 By this we know that we abide in Him, and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit. 14 And we have seen and testify that (S)the Father has sent the Son as Savior of the world. 15 Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. 16 And we have known and believed the love that God has for us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God (V)in him. 17 Love has been perfected among us in this: that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as He is, so are we in this world. 18 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves torment. But he who fears has not been made perfect in love. 19 We love [c]Him because He first loved us. 20 If someone says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, [d]how can he love God (Z)whom he has not seen? 21 And this commandment we have from Him: that he who loves God must love his brother also.

New Life Version,NLV,1 John,1,Christthe Word of Life,"Christ is the Word of Life. He was from the beginning. We have heard Him and have seen Him with our own eyes. We have looked at Him and put our hands on Him. 2 Christ Who is Life was shown to us. We saw Him. We tell you and preach about the Life that lasts forever. He was with the Father and He has come down to us. 3 We are preaching what we have heard and seen. We want you to share together with us what we have with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ. 4 We are writing this to you so our joy may be full. 5 This is what we heard Him tell us. We are passing it on to you. God is light. There is no darkness in Him. 6 If we say we are joined together with Him but live in darkness, we are telling a lie. We are not living the truth. 7 If we live in the light as He is in the light, we share what we have in God with each other. And the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, makes our lives clean from all sin. 8 If we say that we have no sin, we lie to ourselves and the truth is not in us. 9 If we tell Him our sins, He is faithful and we can depend on Him to forgive us of our sins. He will make our lives clean from all sin. 10 If we say we have not sinned, we make God a liar. And His Word is not in our hearts. "
New King James Version,NKJV,1 John,3,The Command to Love,"Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that (B)we should be called children of [a]God! Therefore the world does not know [b]us, (C)because it did not know Him. 2 Beloved, now we are children of God; and (E)it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when He is revealed, (F)we shall be like Him, for (G)we shall see Him as He is. 3 And everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure. 4 Whoever commits sin also commits lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness. 5 And you know that He was manifested (K)to take away our sins, and (L)in Him there is no sin. 6 Whoever abides in Him does not sin. Whoever sins has neither seen Him nor known Him. 7 Little children, let no one deceive you. He who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous. 8 He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, (N)that He might destroy the works of the devil. 9 Whoever has been born of God does not sin, for (P)His seed remains in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been born of God. 10 In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother. 11 For this is the message that you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another, 12 not as Cain who was of the wicked one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his works were evil and his brothers righteous. 13 Do not marvel, my brethren, if the world hates you. 14 We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love [c]his brother abides in death. 15 Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that (V)no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. 16 By this we know love, (X)because He laid down His life for us. And we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. 17 But whoever has this worlds goods, and sees his brother in need, and shuts up his heart from him, how does the love of God abide in him? 18 My little children, let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth. 19 And by this we [d]know that we are of the truth, and shall [e]assure our hearts before Him. 20 For if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things. 21 Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence toward God. 22 And whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments (AE)and do those things that are pleasing in His sight. 23 And this is His commandment: that we should believe on the name of His Son Jesus Christ and love one another, as He gave [f]us commandment. 24 Now he who keeps His commandments (AH)abides in Him, and He in him. And (AI)by this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He has given us. "
New Matthew Bible,NMB,1 John,1,,"That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life  2 for the life appeared, and we have seen and bear witness and proclaim to you that eternal life, which was with the Father and appeared to us  3 that which we have seen and heard, we declare to you so that you may have fellowship with us, and so that our fellowship may be with the Father and his Son Jesus Christ. 4 And this we write to you so that your joy may be full. 5 And this is the tidings that we have heard from him and declare to you: that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. 6 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and yet walk in darkness, we lie, and do not practice the truth. 7 But if we walk in light, even as he is in light, then we have fellowship with him, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanses us from all sin. 8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 10 If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. "
New Life Version,NLV,1 John,5,,"The person who believes that Jesus is the Christ is a child of God. The person who loves the Father loves His children also. 2 This is the way we know we love Gods children. It is when we love God and obey His Word. 3 Loving God means to obey His Word, and His Word is not hard to obey. 4 Every child of God has power over the sins of the world. The way we have power over the sins of the world is by our faith. 5 Who could have power over the world except by believing that Jesus is the Son of God? 6 Jesus Christ came by water and blood. He did not come by water only, but by water and blood. The Holy Spirit speaks about this and He is truth. 7 There are three Who speak of this in heaven: the Father and the Word and the Holy Spirit. These three are one. 8 There are three who speak of this on the earth: the Holy Spirit and the water and the blood. These three speak the same thing. 9 If we believe what men say, we can be sure what God says is more important. God has spoken as He has told us about His Son. 10 The person who puts his trust in Gods Son knows in his own heart that Jesus is the Son of God. The person who does not have his trust in Gods Son makes God a liar. It is because he has not believed the word God spoke about His Son. 11 This is the word He spoke: God gave us life that lasts forever, and this life is in His Son. 12 He that has the Son has life. He that does not have the Son of God does not have life. 13 I have written these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God. Now you can know you have life that lasts forever. 14 We are sure that if we ask anything that He wants us to have, He will hear us. 15 If we are sure He hears us when we ask, we can be sure He will give us what we ask for. 16 You may see a Christian brother sinning in a way that does not lead to death. You should pray for him. God will give him life unless he has done that sin that leads to death. There is a sin that leads to death. There is no reason to pray for him if he has done that sin. 17 Every kind of wrong-doing is sin. But there is a sin that does not lead to death. 18 We know that no child of God keeps on sinning. The Son of God watches over him and the devil cannot get near him. 19 We know that we belong to God, but the whole world is under the power of the devil. 20 We know Gods Son has come. He has given us the understanding to know Him Who is the true God. We are joined together with the true God through His Son, Jesus Christ. He is the true God and the life that lasts forever. 21 My children, keep yourselves from false gods. "
New Life Version,NLV,1 John,4,The Spirits Must Be Tested,"Dear Christian friends, do not believe every spirit. But test the spirits to see if they are from God for there are many false preachers in the world. 2 You can tell if the spirit is from God in this way: Every spirit that says Jesus Christ has come in a human body is from God. 3 And every spirit that does not say Jesus has come in a human body is not from God. It is the teaching of the false-christ. You have heard that this teaching is coming. It is already here in the world. 4 My children, you are a part of Gods family. You have stood against these false preachers and had power over them. You had power over them because the One Who lives in you is stronger than the one who is in the world. 5 Those false teachers are a part of the world. They speak about the things of the world. The world listens to them. 6 We are a part of Gods family. The person who knows God will listen to us. The person who is not a part of Gods family will not listen to us. In this way, we can tell what is the spirit of truth and what is the spirit of false teaching. 7 Dear friends, let us love each other, because love comes from God. Those who love are Gods children and they know God. 8 Those who do not love do not know God because God is love. 9 God has shown His love to us by sending His only Son into the world. God did this so we might have life through Christ. 10 This is love! It is not that we loved God but that He loved us. For God sent His Son to pay for our sins with His own blood. 11 Dear friends, if God loved us that much, then we should love each other. 12 No person has ever seen God at any time. If we love each other, God lives in us. His love is made perfect in us. 13 He has given us His Spirit. This is how we live by His help and He lives in us. 14 We have seen and are able to say that the Father sent His Son to save the world from the punishment of sin. 15 The person who tells of Him in front of men and says that Jesus is the Son of God, God is living in that one and that one is living by the help of God. 16 We have come to know and believe the love God has for us. God is love. If you live in love, you live by the help of God and God lives in you. 17 Love is made perfect in us when we are not ashamed as we stand before Him on the day He judges. For we know that our life in this world is His life lived in us. 18 There is no fear in love. Perfect love puts fear out of our hearts. People have fear when they are afraid of being punished. The man who is afraid does not have perfect love. 19 We love Him because He loved us first. 20 If a person says, I love God, but hates his brother, he is a liar. If a person does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God Whom he has not seen? 21 We have these words from Him. If you love God, love your brother also. "
New Living Translation,NLT,1 John,4,Discerning False Prophets,"Dear friends, do not believe everyone who claims to speak by the Spirit. You must test them to see if the spirit they have comes from God. For there are many false prophets in the world. 2 This is how we know if they have the Spirit of God: If a person claiming to be a prophet[a] acknowledges that Jesus Christ came in a real body, that person has the Spirit of God. 3 But if someone claims to be a prophet and does not acknowledge the truth about Jesus, that person is not from God. Such a person has the spirit of the Antichrist, which you heard is coming into the world and indeed is already here. 4 But you belong to God, my dear children. You have already won a victory over those people, because the Spirit who lives in you is greater than the spirit who lives in the world. 5 Those people belong to this world, so they speak from the worlds viewpoint, and the world listens to them. 6 But we belong to God, and those who know God listen to us. If they do not belong to God, they do not listen to us. That is how we know if someone has the Spirit of truth or the spirit of deception. 7 Dear friends, let us continue to love one another, for love comes from God. Anyone who loves is a child of God and knows God. 8 But anyone who does not love does not know God, for God is love. 9 God showed how much he loved us by sending his one and only Son into the world so that we might have eternal life through him. 10 This is real lovenot that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as a sacrifice to take away our sins. 11 Dear friends, since God loved us that much, we surely ought to love each other. 12 No one has ever seen God. But if we love each other, God lives in us, and his love is brought to full expression in us. 13 And God has given us his Spirit as proof that we live in him and he in us. 14 Furthermore, we have seen with our own eyes and now testify that the Father sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. 15 All who declare that Jesus is the Son of God have God living in them, and they live in God. 16 We know how much God loves us, and we have put our trust in his love. God is love, and all who live in love live in God, and God lives in them. 17 And as we live in God, our love grows more perfect. So we will not be afraid on the day of judgment, but we can face him with confidence because we live like Jesus here in this world. 18 Such love has no fear, because perfect love expels all fear. If we are afraid, it is for fear of punishment, and this shows that we have not fully experienced his perfect love. 19 We love each other[b] because he loved us first. 20 If someone says, I love God, but hates a fellow believer,[c] that person is a liar; for if we dont love people we can see, how can we love God, whom we cannot see? 21 And he has given us this command: Those who love God must also love their fellow believers.[d] "
New Matthew Bible,NMB,1 John,3,,"Behold what love the Father has shown on us, that we should be called the children of God. Because of this, the world does not know you: because it does not know him. 2 Dearly beloveds, now we are the children of God. And yet it does not appear what we will be. But we know that when he appears, we shall be like him. For we shall see him as he is. 3 And everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself, even as he is pure. 4 Whoever commits sin, commits unrighteousness also. For sin is unrighteousness. 5 And you know that he appeared to take away our sins, and in him is no sin. 6 As many as abide in him do not sin. Whoever sins has not seen him, neither has known him. 7 Babes, let no one deceive you. He who does righteousness is righteous, just as he is righteous. 8 He who commits sin is of the devil. For the devil has sinned since the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God appeared: to destroy the works of the devil. 9 Whosoever is born of God does not sin, for his seed remains in him, and he cannot sin because he is born of God. 10 In this are the children of God known, and the children of the devil. Whoever does not work righteousness is not of God, neither he who does not love his brother. 11 For this is the message that you heard from the beginning: that you should love one another  12 not like Cain, who was of the wicked one and slew his brother. And why did he slay him? Because his own works were evil, and his brothers good. 13 Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hates you. 14 We know that we are translated from death to life because we love the brethren. He who does not love his brother, abides in death. 15 Whosoever hates his brother is a man-slayer. And you know that no man-slayer has eternal life abiding in him. 16 By this we perceive love: that he gave his life for us. And therefore we also ought to give our lives for the brethren. 17 Whoever has this worlds goods, and sees his brother in need, and shuts up his compassion from him, how does the love of God dwell in him? 18 My babes, let us not love in word, nor in tongue, but in deed and in truth. 19 For by this we know that we are of the truth, and can quiet our hearts before him. 20 But if our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts, and knows all things. 21 Beloveds, if our hearts do not condemn us, then we have trust before God  22 and whatever we ask, we shall receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. 23 And this is his commandment: that we believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave commandment. 24 And he who keeps his commandments dwells in him, and he in him. And by this we know that there abides in us of the Spirit that he gave us. "
New Living Translation,NLT,1 John,3,Love One Another,"See how very much our Father loves us, for he calls us his children, and that is what we are! But the people who belong to this world dont recognize that we are Gods children because they dont know him. 2 Dear friends, we are already Gods children, but he has not yet shown us what we will be like when Christ appears. But we do know that we will be like him, for we will see him as he really is. 3 And all who have this eager expectation will keep themselves pure, just as he is pure. 4 Everyone who sins is breaking Gods law, for all sin is contrary to the law of God. 5 And you know that Jesus came to take away our sins, and there is no sin in him. 6 Anyone who continues to live in him will not sin. But anyone who keeps on sinning does not know him or understand who he is. 7 Dear children, dont let anyone deceive you about this: When people do what is right, it shows that they are righteous, even as Christ is righteous. 8 But when people keep on sinning, it shows that they belong to the devil, who has been sinning since the beginning. But the Son of God came to destroy the works of the devil. 9 Those who have been born into Gods family do not make a practice of sinning, because Gods life[a] is in them. So they cant keep on sinning, because they are children of God. 10 So now we can tell who are children of God and who are children of the devil. Anyone who does not live righteously and does not love other believers[b] does not belong to God. 11 This is the message you have heard from the beginning: We should love one another. 12 We must not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and killed his brother. And why did he kill him? Because Cain had been doing what was evil, and his brother had been doing what was righteous. 13 So dont be surprised, dear brothers and sisters,[c] if the world hates you. 14 If we love our brothers and sisters who are believers,[d] it proves that we have passed from death to life. But a person who has no love is still dead. 15 Anyone who hates another brother or sister[e] is really a murderer at heart. And you know that murderers dont have eternal life within them. 16 We know what real love is because Jesus gave up his life for us. So we also ought to give up our lives for our brothers and sisters. 17 If someone has enough money to live well and sees a brother or sister[f] in need but shows no compassionhow can Gods love be in that person? 18 Dear children, lets not merely say that we love each other; let us show the truth by our actions. 19 Our actions will show that we belong to the truth, so we will be confident when we stand before God. 20 Even if we feel guilty, God is greater than our feelings, and he knows everything. 21 Dear friends, if we dont feel guilty, we can come to God with bold confidence. 22 And we will receive from him whatever we ask because we obey him and do the things that please him. 23 And this is his commandment: We must believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, just as he commanded us. 24 Those who obey Gods commandments remain in fellowship with him, and he with them. And we know he lives in us because the Spirit he gave us lives in us. "
New Living Translation,NLT,1 John,5,Faith in the Son of God,"Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ[a] has become a child of God. And everyone who loves the Father loves his children, too. 2 We know we love Gods children if we love God and obey his commandments. 3 Loving God means keeping his commandments, and his commandments are not burdensome. 4 For every child of God defeats this evil world, and we achieve this victory through our faith. 5 And who can win this battle against the world? Only those who believe that Jesus is the Son of God. 6 And Jesus Christ was revealed as Gods Son by his baptism in water and by shedding his blood on the cross[b]not by water only, but by water and blood. And the Spirit, who is truth, confirms it with his testimony. 7 So we have these three witnesses[c] 8 the Spirit, the water, and the bloodand all three agree. 9 Since we believe human testimony, surely we can believe the greater testimony that comes from God. And God has testified about his Son. 10 All who believe in the Son of God know in their hearts that this testimony is true. Those who dont believe this are actually calling God a liar because they dont believe what God has testified about his Son. 11 And this is what God has testified: He has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12 Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have Gods Son does not have life. 13 I have written this to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know you have eternal life. 14 And we are confident that he hears us whenever we ask for anything that pleases him. 15 And since we know he hears us when we make our requests, we also know that he will give us what we ask for. 16 If you see a fellow believer[d] sinning in a way that does not lead to death, you should pray, and God will give that person life. But there is a sin that leads to death, and I am not saying you should pray for those who commit it. 17 All wicked actions are sin, but not every sin leads to death. 18 We know that Gods children do not make a practice of sinning, for Gods Son holds them securely, and the evil one cannot touch them. 19 We know that we are children of God and that the world around us is under the control of the evil one. 20 And we know that the Son of God has come, and he has given us understanding so that we can know the true God.[e] And now we live in fellowship with the true God because we live in fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ. He is the only true God, and he is eternal life. 21 Dear children, keep away from anything that might take Gods place in your hearts.[f] "
New Life Version,NLV,1 John,3,We Are Gods Children,"See what great love the Father has for us that He would call us His children. And that is what we are. For this reason the people of the world do not know who we are because they did not know Him. 2 Dear friends, we are Gods children now. But it has not yet been shown to us what we are going to be. We know that when He comes again, we will be like Him because we will see Him as He is. 3 The person who is looking for this to happen will keep himself pure because Christ is pure. 4 The person who keeps on sinning is guilty of not obeying the Law of God. For sin is breaking the Law of God. 5 You know that Christ came to take away our sins. There is no sin in Him. 6 The person who lives by the help of Christ does not keep on sinning. The person who keeps on sinning has not seen Him or has not known Him. 7 My children, let no one lead you in the wrong way. The man who does what is right, is right with God in the same way as Christ is right with God. 8 The person who keeps on sinning belongs to the devil. The devil has sinned from the beginning. But the Son of God came to destroy the works of the devil. 9 No person who has become a child of God keeps on sinning. This is because the Holy Spirit is in him. He cannot keep on sinning because God is his Father. 10 This is the way you can know who are the children of God and who are the children of the devil. The person who does not keep on doing what is right and does not love his brother does not belong to God. 11 This is what you have heard from the beginning, that we should love each other. 12 Do not be like Cain. He was a child of the devil and killed his brother. Why did he kill him? It was because he did what was sinful and his brother did what was right. 13 Do not be surprised if the world hates you, Christian brothers. 14 We know we have passed from death into life. We know this because we love the Christians. The person who does not love has not passed from death into life. 15 A man who hates his brother is a killer in his heart. You know that life which lasts forever is not in one who kills. 16 We know what love is because Christ gave His life for us. We should give our lives for our brothers. 17 What if a person has enough money to live on and sees his brother in need of food and clothing? If he does not help him, how can the love of God be in him? 18 My children, let us not love with words or in talk only. Let us love by what we do and in truth. 19 This is how we know we are Christians. It will give our heart comfort for sure when we stand before Him. 20 Our heart may say that we have done wrong. But remember, God is greater than our heart. He knows everything. 21 Dear friends, if our heart does not say that we are wrong, we will have no fear as we stand before Him. 22 We will receive from Him whatever we ask if we obey Him and do what He wants. 23 This is what He said we must do: Put your trust in the name of His Son, Jesus Christ, and love each other. Christ told us to do this. 24 The person who obeys Christ lives by the help of God and God lives in him. We know He lives in us by the Holy Spirit He has given us. "
New Living Translation,NLT,1 John,1,Introduction,"We proclaim to you the one who existed from the beginning,[a] whom we have heard and seen. We saw him with our own eyes and touched him with our own hands. He is the Word of life. 2 This one who is life itself was revealed to us, and we have seen him. And now we testify and proclaim to you that he is the one who is eternal life. He was with the Father, and then he was revealed to us. 3 We proclaim to you what we ourselves have actually seen and heard so that you may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. 4 We are writing these things so that you may fully share our joy.[b] 5 This is the message we heard from Jesus[c] and now declare to you: God is light, and there is no darkness in him at all. 6 So we are lying if we say we have fellowship with God but go on living in spiritual darkness; we are not practicing the truth. 7 But if we are living in the light, as God is in the light, then we have fellowship with each other, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from all sin. 8 If we claim we have no sin, we are only fooling ourselves and not living in the truth. 9 But if we confess our sins to him, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness. 10 If we claim we have not sinned, we are calling God a liar and showing that his word has no place in our hearts. "
"New Revised Standard Version, Anglicised",NRSVA,1 John,1,The Word of Life,"We declare to you what was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have looked at and touched with our hands, concerning the word of life 2 this life was revealed, and we have seen it and testify to it, and declare to you the eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us 3 we declare to you what we have seen and heard so that you also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. 4 We are writing these things so that our[a] joy may be complete. 5 This is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you, that God is light and in him there is no darkness at all. 6 If we say that we have fellowship with him while we are walking in darkness, we lie and do not do what is true; 7 but if we walk in the light as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. 8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 9 If we confess our sins, he who is faithful and just will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 10 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. "
New Matthew Bible,NMB,1 John,4,,"Ye beloveds, believe not every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God or not. For many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 By this you may know the spirit that is of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh, is of God. 3 And every spirit which does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh, is not of God; and this is the spirit of Antichrist, of whom you have heard that he would come. And even now already he is in the world. 4 Little children, you are of God, and have overcome them. For greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. 5 They are of the world, and therefore what they say is of the world, and the world hears them. 6 We are of God. He who knows God, hears us. He who is not of God, does not hear us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error. 7 Beloveds, let us love one another. For love comes of God. And every one who loves is born of God and knows God. 8 He who does not love, does not know God. For God is love. 9 In this did the love of God for us appear, that God sent his only begotten Son into the world so that we may live through him. 10 Herein is love  not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. 11 Beloveds, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. 12 No man has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwells in us, and his love is perfected in us. 13 By this we know that we dwell in him, and he in us  because he has given us of his Spirit. 14 And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son, who is the Saviour of the world. 15 Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, in him dwells God, and he in God. 16 And we have known and believed the love that God has to us. God is love, and he who dwells in love dwells in God, and God in him. 17 In this is the love made perfect in us, so that we may have trust in the day of judgment. For as he is, even so are we in this world. 18 There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out all fear. For fear has painfulness. He who fears is not perfect in love. 19 We love him because he first loved us. 20 If a person says, I love God, and yet hates his brother, he is a liar. For how can he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, love God whom he has not seen? 21 And this commandment we have from him: that he who loves God, should love his brother also. "
New Matthew Bible,NMB,1 John,2,,"My little children, these things I write to you so that you do not sin. Yet if anyone sins, we have an advocate with the Father: Jesus Christ the Righteous, 2 and he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for our sins only, but also for the sins of all the world. 3 And hereby are we sure that we know him: if we keep his commandments. 4 He who says, I know him, and does not keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 5 Whoever keeps his word, in him is the love of God perfected in deed. And thereby we know that we are in him. 6 He who says he abides in him ought to walk even as he walked. 7 Brethren, I write no new commandment to you, but that old commandment that you heard from the beginning. The old commandment is the word that you heard from the beginning. 8 Again, a new commandment I write to you, a thing that is true in him and also in you. For the darkness is past and the true light now shines. 9 He who says that he is in the light and yet hates his brother, is in darkness even until this time. 10 He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no occasion of evil in him. 11 He who hates his brother is in darkness, and walks in darkness, and does not know where he goes because the darkness has blinded his eyes. 12 Babes, I write to you because your sins are forgiven you for his names sake. 13 I write to you fathers because you know him who was from the beginning. I write to you young men because you have overcome the wicked one. I write to you little children because you know the Father. 14 I write to you fathers because you know him who was from the beginning. I write to you young men because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome that wicked one. 15 See that you love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in the world (as the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of goods) is not of the Father, but of the world. 17 And the world is vanishing away, and the desires of it. But he who fulfils the will of God endures forever. 18 Little children, it is the last time. And as you have heard that Antichrist shall come, even now there are many Antichrists come already. By this we know that it is the last time. 19 They went out from us, but they were not of us. For if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us. But this happened so that it might appear that they were not of us. 20 And you have an anointing of the Holy Spirit, and you know all things. 21 I did not write to you as though you did not know the truth, but as knowing it, and as knowing also that no lie comes of truth. 22 Who is a liar, but he who denies that Jesus is Christ? He is the Antichrist, who denies the Father and the Son. 23 Whoever denies the Son, the same does not have the Father. 24 Let therefore abide in you that which you heard from the beginning. If that which you heard from the beginning remains in you, you also will continue in the Son and in the Father. 25 And the promise that he has promised us is eternal life. 26 This I have written to you concerning those who deceive you. 27 And the anointing that you have received from him dwells in you, and you need not that any man teach you  but as the anointing teaches you all things, and is true, and is no lie, and as it taught you, even so abide therein. 28 And now babes, abide in him, so that when he appears we may be bold, and not be made ashamed before him at his coming. 29 If you know that he is righteous, know also that he who follows righteousness is born of him. "
New Life Version,NLV,1 John,2,Christ Is Our Helper,"My dear children, I am writing this to you so you will not sin. But if anyone does sin, there is One Who will go between him and the Father. He is Jesus Christ, the One Who is right with God. 2 He paid for our sins with His own blood. He did not pay for ours only, but for the sins of the whole world. 3 We can be sure that we know Him if we obey His teaching. 4 Anyone who says, I know Him, but does not obey His teaching is a liar. There is no truth in him. 5 But whoever obeys His Word has the love of God made perfect in him. This is the way to know if you belong to Christ. 6 The one who says he belongs to Christ should live the same kind of life Christ lived. 7 Dear friends, I am not writing a new Law for you to obey. It is an old Law you have had from the beginning. The old Law is the Word that you have heard. 8 And yet it is a new Law that I am writing to you. It is truth. It was seen in Christ and it is seen in you also. The darkness is passing away and the true Light shines instead. 9 Whoever says he is in the light but hates his brother is still in darkness. 10 But whoever loves his brother is in the light. And there will be no reason to sin because of him. 11 Whoever hates his brother is not in the light but lives in darkness. He does not know where he is going because the darkness has blinded his eyes. 12 I am writing to you, my children, for your sins have been forgiven because of Christs name. 13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you know Him Who has been from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have power over the devil. I have written to you, young boys and girls, because you have learned to know the Father. 14 I have written to you, fathers, because you know Him Who has been from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong. You have kept Gods Word in your hearts. You have power over the devil. 15 Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, the Fathers love is not in him. 16 For everything that is in the world does not come from the Father. The desires of our flesh and the things our eyes see and want and the pride of this life come from the world. 17 The world and all its desires will pass away. But the man who obeys God and does what He wants done will live forever. 18 My children, we are near the end of the world. You have heard that the false-christ is coming. Many false-christs have already come. This is how we know the end of the world is near. 19 These left us. But they never belonged to us. If they had been a part of us, they would have stayed with us. Because they left, it is known they did not belong to us. 20 The Holy Spirit has been given to you and you all know the truth. 21 I have not written to you because you do not know the truth. I have written because you do know the truth and you know that no lie comes from the truth. 22 Who is a liar? He is a person who says that Jesus is not the Christ. The false-christ will have nothing to do with the Father and the Son and he will turn away from Them. 23 A person who will have nothing to do with the Son and turns against Him does not have the Father. The one who says he knows the Son has the Father also. 24 Keep in your heart what you have heard from the beginning. Then you will belong to the Son and to the Father if what you have heard from the beginning is in you. 25 And He has promised us life that lasts forever! 26 I have written to you about those who are trying to lead you in the wrong way. 27 Christ gave you the Holy Spirit and He lives in you. You do not need anyone to teach you. The Holy Spirit is able to teach you all things. What He teaches you is truth and not a lie. Live by the help of Christ as the Holy Spirit has taught you. 28 And now, my children, live by the help of Him. Then when He comes again, we will be glad to see Him and not be ashamed. 29 You know that Christ is right with God. Then you should know that everyone who is right with God is a child of His. "
New Matthew Bible,NMB,1 John,5,,"Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God. And everyone who loves him who begat, loves also the child who was born of him. 2 In this we know that we love the children of God: when we love God and keep his commandments. 3 This is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not grievous. 4 For all that is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that overcomes the world, even our faith. 5 Who is it that overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? 6 This Jesus Christ is he who came by water and blood  not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that bears witness, because the Spirit is truth. 7 (For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one.) 8 And there are three which bear witness (in earth): the Spirit, and the water, and the blood; and these three are one. 9 If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater. For this is the witness of God, which he testified of his Son. 10 He who believes on the Son of God has the witness in himself. He who does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed the testimony that God gave of his Son. 11 And this is that testimony: that God has given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12 He who has the Son has life, and he who does not have the Son of God, does not have life. 13 These things I have written to you who believe on the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life, and so that you may believe on the name of the Son of God. 14 And this is the trust that we have in him: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. 15 And if we know that he hears us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we will have the petitions that we ask of him. 16 If anyone sees his brother sin a sin that is not unto death, let him ask, and he will give him life for those who do not sin unto death. There is a sin unto death, for which I do not say that a person should pray. 17 All unrighteousness is sin, but there is sin not unto death. 18 We know that whoever is born of God does not sin, but he who is begotten of God keeps himself, and that wicked one does not touch him. 19 We know that we are of God, and that the world is altogether set on wickedness. 20 We know that the Son of God has come, and has given us a mind to know him who is true. And we are in him who is true through his Son Jesus Christ. This same is very God and eternal life. 21 Babes, keep yourselvesfrom idols.Amen. "
"New Revised Standard Version, Anglicised",NRSVA,1 John,2,Christ Our Advocate,"My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; 2 and he is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world. 3 Now by this we may be sure that we know him, if we obey his commandments. 4 Whoever says, I have come to know him, but does not obey his commandments, is a liar, and in such a person the truth does not exist; 5 but whoever obeys his word, truly in this person the love of God has reached perfection. By this we may be sure that we are in him: 6 whoever says, I abide in him, ought to walk just as he walked. 7 Beloved, I am writing you no new commandment, but an old commandment that you have had from the beginning; the old commandment is the word that you have heard. 8 Yet I am writing you a new commandment that is true in him and in you, because[a] the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining. 9 Whoever says, I am in the light, while hating a brother or sister,[b] is still in the darkness. 10 Whoever loves a brother or sister[c] lives in the light, and in such a person[d] there is no cause for stumbling. 11 But whoever hates another believer[e] is in the darkness, walks in the darkness, and does not know the way to go, because the darkness has brought on blindness. 12 I am writing to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven on account of his name. 13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young people, because you have conquered the evil one. 14 I write to you, children, because you know the Father. I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young people, because you are strong and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one. 15 Do not love the world or the things in the world. The love of the Father is not in those who love the world; 16 for all that is in the worldthe desire of the flesh, the desire of the eyes, the pride in richescomes not from the Father but from the world. 17 And the world and its desire[f] are passing away, but those who do the will of God live for ever. 18 Children, it is the last hour! As you have heard that antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have come. From this we know that it is the last hour. 19 They went out from us, but they did not belong to us; for if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us. But by going out they made it plain that none of them belongs to us. 20 But you have been anointed by the Holy One, and all of you have knowledge.[g] 21 I write to you, not because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and you know that no lie comes from the truth. 22 Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ?[h] This is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son. 23 No one who denies the Son has the Father; everyone who confesses the Son has the Father also. 24 Let what you heard from the beginning abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then you will abide in the Son and in the Father. 25 And this is what he has promised us,[i] eternal life. 26 I write these things to you concerning those who would deceive you. 27 As for you, the anointing that you received from him abides in you, and so you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things, and is true and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, abide in him.[j] 28 And now, little children, abide in him, so that when he is revealed we may have confidence and not be put to shame before him at his coming. 29 If you know that he is righteous, you may be sure that everyone who does right has been born of him.

New Living Translation,NLT,1 John,2,A New Commandment,"My dear children, I am writing this to you so that you will not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate who pleads our case before the Father. He is Jesus Christ, the one who is truly righteous. 2 He himself is the sacrifice that atones for our sinsand not only our sins but the sins of all the world. 3 And we can be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments. 4 If someone claims, I know God, but doesnt obey Gods commandments, that person is a liar and is not living in the truth. 5 But those who obey Gods word truly show how completely they love him. That is how we know we are living in him. 6 Those who say they live in God should live their lives as Jesus did. 7 Dear friends, I am not writing a new commandment for you; rather it is an old one you have had from the very beginning. This old commandmentto love one anotheris the same message you heard before. 8 Yet it is also new. Jesus lived the truth of this commandment, and you also are living it. For the darkness is disappearing, and the true light is already shining. 9 If anyone claims, I am living in the light, but hates a fellow believer,[a] that person is still living in darkness. 10 Anyone who loves a fellow believer[b] is living in the light and does not cause others to stumble. 11 But anyone who hates a fellow believer is still living and walking in darkness. Such a person does not know the way to go, having been blinded by the darkness. 12 I am writing to you who are Gods children because your sins have been forgiven through Jesus.[c] 13 I am writing to you who are mature in the faith[d] because you know Christ, who existed from the beginning. I am writing to you who are young in the faith because you have won your battle with the evil one. 14 I have written to you who are Gods children because you know the Father. I have written to you who are mature in the faith because you know Christ, who existed from the beginning. I have written to you who are young in the faith because you are strong. Gods word lives in your hearts, and you have won your battle with the evil one. 15 Do not love this world nor the things it offers you, for when you love the world, you do not have the love of the Father in you. 16 For the world offers only a craving for physical pleasure, a craving for everything we see, and pride in our achievements and possessions. These are not from the Father, but are from this world. 17 And this world is fading away, along with everything that people crave. But anyone who does what pleases God will live forever. 18 Dear children, the last hour is here. You have heard that the Antichrist is coming, and already many such antichrists have appeared. From this we know that the last hour has come. 19 These people left our churches, but they never really belonged with us; otherwise they would have stayed with us. When they left, it proved that they did not belong with us. 20 But you are not like that, for the Holy One has given you his Spirit,[e] and all of you know the truth. 21 So I am writing to you not because you dont know the truth but because you know the difference between truth and lies. 22 And who is a liar? Anyone who says that Jesus is not the Christ.[f] Anyone who denies the Father and the Son is an antichrist.[g] 23 Anyone who denies the Son doesnt have the Father, either. But anyone who acknowledges the Son has the Father also. 24 So you must remain faithful to what you have been taught from the beginning. If you do, you will remain in fellowship with the Son and with the Father. 25 And in this fellowship we enjoy the eternal life he promised us. 26 I am writing these things to warn you about those who want to lead you astray. 27 But you have received the Holy Spirit,[h] and he lives within you, so you dont need anyone to teach you what is true. For the Spirit[i] teaches you everything you need to know, and what he teaches is trueit is not a lie. So just as he has taught you, remain in fellowship with Christ. 28 And now, dear children, remain in fellowship with Christ so that when he returns, you will be full of courage and not shrink back from him in shame. 29 Since we know that Christ is righteous, we also know that all who do what is right are Gods children.

And this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming; and now it is already in the world. 4 Little children, you are from God, and have conquered them; for the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. 5 They are from the world; therefore what they say is from the world, and the world listens to them. 6 We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us, and whoever is not from God does not listen to us. From this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error. 7 Beloved, let us love one another, because love is from God; everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. 8 Whoever does not love does not know God, for God is love. 9 Gods love was revealed among us in this way: God sent his only Son into the world so that we might live through him. 10 In this is love, not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins. 11 Beloved, since God loved us so much, we also ought to love one another. 12 No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God lives in us, and his love is perfected in us. 13 By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit. 14 And we have seen and do testify that the Father has sent his Son as the Saviour of the world. 15 God abides in those who confess that Jesus is the Son of God, and they abide in God. 16 So we have known and believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and those who abide in love abide in God, and God abides in them. 17 Love has been perfected among us in this: that we may have boldness on the day of judgement, because as he is, so are we in this world. 18 There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear; for fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not reached perfection in love. 19 We love[b] because he first loved us. 20 Those who say, I love God, and hate their brothers or sisters,[c] are liars; for those who do not love a brother or sister[d] whom they have seen, cannot love God whom they have not seen. 21 The commandment we have from him is this: those who love God must love their brothers and sisters[e] also.

Those who do not believe in God[c] have made him a liar by not believing in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son. 11 And this is the testimony: God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12 Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life. 13 I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life. 14 And this is the boldness we have in him, that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. 15 And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have obtained the requests made of him. 16 If you see your brother or sister[d] committing what is not a mortal sin, you will ask, and God[e] will give life to such a oneto those whose sin is not mortal. There is sin that is mortal; I do not say that you should pray about that. 17 All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that is not mortal. 18 We know that those who are born of God do not sin, but the one who was born of God protects them, and the evil one does not touch them. 19 We know that we are Gods children, and that the whole world lies under the power of the evil one. 20 And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding so that we may know him who is true;[f] and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ.

By this we may be sure that we are in him: 6 whoever says, I abide in him, ought to walk just as he walked. 7 Beloved, I am writing you no new commandment, but an old commandment that you have had from the beginning; the old commandment is the word that you have heard. 8 Yet I am writing you a new commandment that is true in him and in you, because[a] the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining. 9 Whoever says, I am in the light, while hating a brother or sister,[b] is still in the darkness. 10 Whoever loves a brother or sister[c] lives in the light, and in such a person[d] there is no cause for stumbling. 11 But whoever hates another believer[e] is in the darkness, walks in the darkness, and does not know the way to go, because the darkness has brought on blindness. 12 I am writing to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven on account of his name. 13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young people, because you have conquered the evil one. 14 I write to you, children, because you know the Father. I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young people, because you are strong and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one. 15 Do not love the world or the things in the world. The love of the Father is not in those who love the world; 16 for all that is in the worldthe desire of the flesh, the desire of the eyes, the pride in richescomes not from the Father but from the world. 17 And the world and its desire[f] are passing away, but those who do the will of God live forever. 18 Children, it is the last hour! As you have heard that antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have come. From this we know that it is the last hour. 19 They went out from us, but they did not belong to us; for if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us. But by going out they made it plain that none of them belongs to us. 20 But you have been anointed by the Holy One, and all of you have knowledge.[g] 21 I write to you, not because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and you know that no lie comes from the truth. 22 Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ?[h] This is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son. 23 No one who denies the Son has the Father; everyone who confesses the Son has the Father also. 24 Let what you heard from the beginning abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then you will abide in the Son and in the Father. 25 And this is what he has promised us,[i] eternal life. 26 I write these things to you concerning those who would deceive you. 27 As for you, the anointing that you received from him abides in you, and so you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things, and is true and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, abide in him.[j] 28 And now, little children, abide in him, so that when he is revealed we may have confidence and not be put to shame before him at his coming. 29 If you know that he is righteous, you may be sure that everyone who does right has been born of him.

New Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition,NRSVCE,1 John,4,Testing the Spirits,"Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God; for many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, 3 and every spirit that does not confess Jesus[a] is not from God. And this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming; and now it is already in the world. 4 Little children, you are from God, and have conquered them; for the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. 5 They are from the world; therefore what they say is from the world, and the world listens to them. 6 We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us, and whoever is not from God does not listen to us. From this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error. 7 Beloved, let us love one another, because love is from God; everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. 8 Whoever does not love does not know God, for God is love. 9 Gods love was revealed among us in this way: God sent his only Son into the world so that we might live through him. 10 In this is love, not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins. 11 Beloved, since God loved us so much, we also ought to love one another. 12 No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God lives in us, and his love is perfected in us. 13 By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit. 14 And we have seen and do testify that the Father has sent his Son as the Savior of the world. 15 God abides in those who confess that Jesus is the Son of God, and they abide in God. 16 So we have known and believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and those who abide in love abide in God, and God abides in them. 17 Love has been perfected among us in this: that we may have boldness on the day of judgment, because as he is, so are we in this world. 18 There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear; for fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not reached perfection in love. 19 We love[b] because he first loved us. 20 Those who say, I love God, and hate their brothers or sisters,[c] are liars; for those who do not love a brother or sister[d] whom they have seen, cannot love God whom they have not seen. 21 The commandment we have from him is this: those who love God must love their brothers and sisters[e] also.

New Revised Standard Version Updated Edition,NRSVUE,1 John,3,Love One Another,"1 See what love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God, and that is what we are. The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him. 2 Beloved, we are Gods children now; what we will be has not yet been revealed. What we do know is this: when he[a] is revealed, we will be like him, for we will see him as he is. 3 And all who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is pure. 4 Everyone who commits sin is guilty of lawlessness; sin is lawlessness. 5 You know that he was revealed to take away sins, and in him there is no sin. 6 No one who abides in him sins; no one who sins has either seen him or known him. 7 Little children,[b] let no one deceive you. Everyone who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous. 8 Everyone who commits sin is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The Son of God was revealed for this purpose: to destroy the works of the devil. 9 Those who have been born of God do not sin because Gods seed abides in them;[c] they cannot sin because they have been born of God. 10 The children of God and the children of the devil are revealed in this way: all who do not do what is right are not from God, nor are those who do not love a brother or sister. 11 For this is the message you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another. 12 We must not be like Cain, who was from the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brothers righteous. 13 Do not be astonished, brothers and sisters, that the world hates you. 14 We know that we have passed from death to life because we love the brothers and sisters. Whoever does not love abides in death. 15 All who hate a brother or sister are murderers, and you know that murderers do not have eternal life abiding in them. 16 We know love by this, that he laid down his life for usand we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers and sisters. 17 How does Gods love abide in anyone who has the worlds goods and sees a brother or sister in need and yet refuses help? 18 Little children, let us love not in word or speech but in deed and truth. 19 And by this we will know that we are from the truth and will reassure our hearts before him 20 whenever our hearts condemn us, for God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything. 21 Beloved, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have boldness before God, 22 and we receive from him whatever we ask, because we obey his commandments and do what pleases him. 23 And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he has commanded us. 24 All who obey his commandments abide in him, and he abides in them.

New Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition,NRSVCE,1 John,5,Faith Conquers the World,"Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ[a] has been born of God, and everyone who loves the parent loves the child. 2 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments. 3 For the love of God is this, that we obey his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome, 4 for whatever is born of God conquers the world. And this is the victory that conquers the world, our faith. 5 Who is it that conquers the world but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? 6 This is the one who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ, not with the water only but with the water and the blood. And the Spirit is the one that testifies, for the Spirit is the truth. 7 There are three that testify:[b] 8 the Spirit and the water and the blood, and these three agree. 9 If we receive human testimony, the testimony of God is greater; for this is the testimony of God that he has testified to his Son. 10 Those who believe in the Son of God have the testimony in their hearts. Those who do not believe in God[c] have made him a liar by not believing in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son. 11 And this is the testimony: God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12 Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life. 13 I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life. 14 And this is the boldness we have in him, that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. 15 And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have obtained the requests made of him. 16 If you see your brother or sister[d] committing what is not a mortal sin, you will ask, and God[e] will give life to such a oneto those whose sin is not mortal. There is sin that is mortal; I do not say that you should pray about that. 17 All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that is not mortal. 18 We know that those who are born of God do not sin, but the one who was born of God protects them, and the evil one does not touch them. 19 We know that we are Gods children, and that the whole world lies under the power of the evil one. 20 And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding so that we may know him who is true;[f] and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ.

New Testament for Everyone,NTFE,1 John,4,False prophets,"Beloved, do not believe every spirit. Rather, test the spirits to see whether they are from God. Many false prophets, you see, have gone out into the world. 2 This is how we know Gods spirit: every spirit that agrees that Jesus the Messiah has come in the flesh is from God, 3 and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This spirit is actually the spirit of the Antimessiah. You have heard that it was coming, and now it is already in the world. 4 But you, children, are from God, and you have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. 5 They are from the world, and that is why they speak from the world, and why the world listens to them. 6 We are from God; people who know God listen to us, but people who are not from God do not listen to us. That is how we can tell the spirit of truth from the spirit of error. 7 Beloved, let us love one another, because love is from God, and all who love are fathered by God and know God. 8 The one who does not love has not known God, because God is love. 9 This is how Gods love has appeared among us: God sent his only son into the world, so that we should live through him. 10 Love consists in this: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his son to be the sacrifice that would atone for our sins. 11 Beloved, if thats how God loved us, we ought to love one another in the same way. 12 Nobody has ever seen God. If we love one another, God abides in us and his love is completed in us. 13 That is how we know that we abide in him, and he in us, because he has given us a portion of his spirit. 14 And we have seen and bear witness that the father sent the son to be the worlds savior. 15 Anyone who confesses that Jesus is Gods son, God abides in them and they abide in God. 16 And we have known and have believed the love which God has for us. God is love; those who abide in love abide in God, and God abides in them. 17 This is what makes love complete for us, so that we may have boldness and confidence on the day of judgment, because just as he is, so are we within this world. 18 There is no fear in love; complete love drives out fear. Fear has to do with punishment, and anyone who is afraid has not been completed in love. 19 We love, because he first loved us. 20 If someone says, I love God, but hates their brother or sister, that person is a liar. Someone who doesnt love a brother or sister whom they have seen, how can they love God, whom they havent seen? 21 This is the command we have from him: anyone who loves God should love their brother or sister too. "
New Testament for Everyone,NTFE,1 John,5,Faith wins the victory,"Everyone who believes that the Messiah is Jesus has been fathered by God. Everyone who loves the parent loves the child as well. 2 That is how we know that we love the children of God, because we love God and do what he commands. 3 This is what loving God means: it means keeping his commandments. His commandments, whats more, are no trouble, 4 because everything that is fathered by God conquers the world. This is the victory that conquers the world: our faith. 5 Who is the one who conquers the world? Surely the one who believes that Jesus is Gods son! 6 It was he who came by means of water and blood, Jesus the Messiah, not by water only but by the water and the blood. The spirit is the one who bears witness, because the spirit is the truth. 7 There are three that bear witness, you see, 8 the spirit, the water and the blood, and these three agree together. 9 If we have received human witness, Gods witness is greater. This is the witness of God, the testimony he has borne to his son. 10 All those who believe in the son of God have the witness in themselves, but anyone who does not believe God has made a liar of him, because they have not believed in the witness which God bore concerning his son. 11 This is the witness: God has given us the life of the age to come, and this life is in his son. 12 Anyone who has the son has life. Anyone who does not have the son of God does not have life. 13 I am writing these things to you so that you may know that you, who believe in the name of the son of God, do indeed have the life of the age to come. 14 This is the bold confidence we have before him: if we ask for something according to his will, he hears us. 15 And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we already possess the requests we have asked from him. 16 If anyone sees a brother or sister committing a sin which is not deadly, they should ask, and God will give life to the people who are sinning in a way which is not deadly. There is such a thing as deadly sin; I do not say that one should pray about that. 17 All sin is unrighteousness, and there is a sin which is not deadly. 18 We know that everyone fathered by God does not go on sinning. The one who was fathered by God keeps them, and the evil one does not touch them. 19 We know that we are from God, and the whole world is under the power of the evil one. 20 We know that the son of God has come and has given us understanding so that we should know the truth. And we are in the truth, in his son Jesus the Messiah. This is the true God; this is the life of the age to come. 21 Children, guard yourselves against idols. "
Orthodox Jewish Bible,OJB,1 John,2,,"My yeladim, these things I write to you so that you do not commit averos. And if anyone does commit averos, a Melitz Yosher (Advocate) we have with HaAv, Yehoshua/Yeshua, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach the Tzaddik. 2 And he is the kapporah for chattoteinu, not for ours only, but also for the kol HaOlam Hazeh. [VAYIKRA 5:15; YESHAYAH 53:10] 3 And by this we have daas that we have daas of Him, if over the mitzvot of Him we are shomer. 4 The one making the claim, ""I have daas of Him"" and not being shomer over His mitzvot is a shakran (liar) and in this one HaEmes is not. 5 But whoever over the dvar of Him is shomer, beemes in this one the ahavas Hashem has been made shleimah. By this we have daas that in Him we are. 6 The one claiming to make his maon in Him ought with the halakhah of that One so he should have his derech. [Yn 14:1,23; TEHILLIM 1:6] 7 Chaverim, I do not write you a mitzvah chadasha, but a mitzvah yashanah, which you were having from the beginning: the mitzvah yashanah is the dvar which you heard. 8 Again a mitzvah chadasha I write to you, which is HaEmes in Him, and in you, because the choshech is making its histalkus (passing away) and the Ohr HaAmitti (the True Light) already is shining. 9 The one claiming in the Ohr (Light) to be and the Ach bMoshiach of him hating, is in the choshech still. [VAYIKRA 19:17] 10 The one with ahavah for the Ach bMoshiach of him makes his maon (dwelling, permanent residence, Yn 14:2, 23) in the Ohr (Light) and a cause for michshol (stumbling, falling) is not in him. [TEHILLIM 119:165] 11 But the one hating the Ach bMoshiach of him is in the choshech and walks his derech in the choshech and does not have daas where he goes, because the choshech blinded his eyes. 12 I write to you, yeladim, because your averos have been granted selicha (forgiveness) because of SHMO (His Name). [TEHILLIM 25:11] 13 I write to you, avot, because you have had daas of the One Who is Bereshis; I write to you, yunge Leit (young people), because you have conquered the evil one. 14 I wrote to you, yeladim, because you have had daas of HaAv; I wrote to you, avot, because you have had daas of the One Bereshis. I wrote to you, yunge Leit (young people), because you are chazakim (strong ones) and the Dvar Hashem makes His maon in you and you have conquered the evil one. 15 Do not have ahavah for the Olam Hazeh, neither the things in the Olam Hazeh. If anyone has ahavah for the Olam Hazeh, the Ahavas [Elohim] HaAv is not in him. 16 For all that is in the Olam Hazeh, the taavah (lust) of the basar and the taavah of the eyes and the gaavah (pride) in the chashuve (prominence) of what one has in this life, ones vital possessions, all this is not of HaAv but is of the Olam Hazeh. [BERESHIS 3:6; MISHLE 27:20] 17 And the Olam Hazeh is making its histalkus (passing away) and the taavah (lust) of it, but the one doing the ratzon Hashem has his maon lanetzakh (permanent dwelling place to remain for ever). 18 Yeladim, it is the shaah haachronah (the last hour, time), and as you heard that Anti-Moshiach is coming, even now many Anti-Moshiachs [neviei sheker, 4:1] have come, from which we have daas that it is the shaah haachronah. 19 They went out and departed from us, but they were not of us; for if they were of us, they would have abided with us; but they went out that it may be niglah (be revealed) that none of them belongs to us. [Yn 6:70; 13:30] 20 And you have a [Ruach Hakodesh] mishcha (anointing) from HaKadosh and you have daas of all. [YIRMEYAH 31:34] 21 I did not write an iggeret kodesh to you because you do not have daas of HaEmes, but because you do have daas of HaEmes and that kol sheker (every falsehood) is not of HaEmes. 22 Who is the shakran (liar)? Who but the one making hakhchashah (denial) and claiming that Yehoshua is not the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach? This one is the Anti-Moshiach, the one making hakhchashah (denial) of HaAv and HaBen. 23 No one making hakhchashah of HaBen has HaAv; the one making hodaah (confession) of HaBen has HaAv also. 24 What you heard from the beginning, in you let it make its maon. If in you makes maon what from the beginning you heard, also you will make maon in HaBen and in HaAv. 25 And this is the havtachah (promise) which He promised us, Chayyei Olam. 26 These things I wrote to you concerning the [neviei sheker] deceiving you. 27 And the [Ruach Hakodesh] mishcha (anointing) which you received from Him makes its maon in you, and you are not nitzrach (needy) that anyone should be your ""moreh,"" but as the same [Ruach Hakodesh] mishcha (anointing) teaches you concerning everything and is Emes and is not kazav (lie, falsehood), and as He taught you, keep your maon in Him. [YIRMEYAH 31:34] 28 And now, yeladim, remain in Him, that when He makes His hisgalus (revelation, unveiling appearance) we may have bitachon and not have bushah (shame) before Him at the Bias HaMoshiach. 29 If you have daas that He is tzaddik, you have daas that also everyone who is a poel tzedek (worker of righteousness) has been born of Him.

If anyone does sin, we have one who pleads our cause before the fathernamely, the Righteous One, Jesus the Messiah! 2 He is the sacrifice which atones for our sinsand not ours only, either, but those of the whole world. 3 This is how we are sure that we have known him, if we keep his commandments. 4 Anyone who says, I know him, but doesnt keep his commandments, is a liar. People like that have no truth in them. 5 But if anyone keeps his word, Gods love is truly made complete in such a person. This is how we are sure that we are in him: 6 anyone who says, I abide in him, ought to behave in the same way that he behaved. 7 My beloved ones, I am not writing a new command to you, but an old command which you have had from the very beginning. The old command is the word which you heard. 8 Again, however, I am writing a new command to you: it is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining. 9 Anyone who says, I am in the light, while hating another family member, is still in darkness up to this very moment. 10 Anyone who loves another family member abides in the light, and there is no cause of offense in such a person. 11 Anyone who hates another family member is in the darkness, and walks about in the darkness. Such people have no idea where they are going, because the darkness has blinded their eyes. 12 I am writing to you, children, because your sins are forgiven through his name. 13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you have known the one who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young people, because you have conquered the evil one. 14 I have written to you, children, because you have known the father. I have written to you, fathers, because you have known the one who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young people, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have conquered the evil one. 15 Do not love the world, or the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the fathers love is not in them. 16 Everything in the world, you seethe greedy desire of the flesh, the greedy desire of the eyes, the pride of lifenone of this is from the father. It is from the world. 17 The world is passing away, with all its greedy desires. But anyone who does Gods will abides forever. 18 Children, it is the last hour. You have heard that Antimessiah is comingand now many Antimessiahs have appeared! Thats how we know that it is the last hour. 19 They went out from among us, but they were not really of our number. If they had been of our number, you see, they would have remained with us. This happened so that it would be made crystal clear that none of them belonged to us. 20 You, however, have the anointing from the Holy One, and you all have knowledge. 21 I am not writing to you because you dont know the truth, but because you do know it, and you know that no liar is of the truth. 22 Who is the liar? Is it not the one who denies that Jesus is the Messiah? Such a one is the Antimessiahwho denies the father and the son. 23 Nobody who denies the son has the father. One who acknowledges the son has the father too. 24 As for you: let what you heard from the beginning abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you too will abide in the son and in the father. 25 And this is the promise which he himself promised us: the life of the age to come. 26 I am writing to you about the people who are deceiving you. 27 You have received the anointing from him; it abides in you, and you do not need to have anyone teach you. That anointing from him teaches you about everything; it is true, it isnt a lie. So, just as he taught you, abide in him. 28 And now, children, abide in him, so that when he is revealed we may have boldness and may not be put to shame before him at his royal appearing. 29 If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been fathered by him. "
New Testament for Everyone,NTFE,1 John,3,Born of God,"Look at the remarkable love the father has given usthat we should be called Gods children! That indeed is what we are. Thats why the world doesnt know us, because it didnt know him. 2 Beloved ones, we are now, already, Gods children; it hasnt yet been revealed what we are going to be. We know that when he is revealed we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is. 3 All who have this hope in him make themselves pure, just as he is pure. 4 Everyone who goes on sinning is breaking the law; sin, in fact, is lawlessness. 5 And you know that he was revealed so that he might take away sins, and there is no sin in him. 6 Everyone who abides in him does not go on sinning. Everyone who goes on sinning has not seen him, or known him. 7 Children, dont let anyone deceive you. The person who does righteousness is righteous, just as he is righteous. 8 The person who goes on sinning is from the devil, because the devil is a sinner from the very start. The son of God was revealed for this purpose, to destroy the works of the devil. 9 Everyone who is fathered by God does not go on sinning, because Gods offspring remain in him; they cannot go on sinning, because they have been fathered by God. 10 That is how it is clear who are the children of God and who are the children of the devil: everyone who does not do what is right is not of God, particularly those who do not love their brother or sister. 11 This is the message which you heard right from the start, you see, that we should love one another. 12 We should not be like Cain, who was of the evil one, and murdered his brother. Why did he murder him? Because his deeds were evil, while his brothers were right. 13 Dont be surprised, my brothers and sisters, if the world hates you. 14 We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the family. Anyone who doesnt love abides in death. 15 Everyone who hates their brother or sister is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has the life of the coming age abiding in them. 16 This is how we know love: he laid down his life for us. And we too ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters. 17 Anyone who has the means of life in this world, and sees a brother or sister in need, and closes their heart against themhow can Gods love be abiding in them? 18 Children, let us not love in word, or in speech, but in deed and in truth. 19 Because of this, we know we are of the truth, and we will persuade our hearts of this fact before him, 20 because if our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts. He knows everything. 21 Beloved, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have boldness before God, 22 and we receive from him whatever we ask, because we keep his commands and give him pleasure when he sees what we are doing. 23 And this is his command, that we should believe in the name of his son Jesus the Messiah, and should love one another, just as he gave us the commandment. 24 Anyone who keeps his commandments abides in him, and he in them. This is how we know that he abides in us, by his spirit that he has given us. "
New Revised Standard Version Updated Edition,NRSVUE,1 John,4,Testing the Spirits,"Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, 3 and every spirit that does not confess Jesus[a] is not from God. And this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming, and now it is already in the world. 4 Little children, you are from God and have conquered them, for the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. 5 They are from the world; therefore what they say is from the world, and the world listens to them. 6 We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us, and whoever is not from God does not listen to us. From this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error. 7 Beloved, let us love one another, because love is from God; everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. 8 Whoever does not love does not know God, for God is love. 9 Gods love was revealed among us in this way: God sent his only Son into the world so that we might live through him. 10 In this is love, not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins. 11 Beloved, since God loved us so much, we also ought to love one another. 12 No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us, and his love is perfected in us. 13 By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit. 14 And we have seen and do testify that the Father has sent his Son as the Savior of the world. 15 God abides in those who confess that Jesus is the Son of God, and they abide in God. 16 So we have known and believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and those who abide in love abide in God, and God abides in them. 17 Love has been perfected among us in this: that we may have boldness on the day of judgment, because as he is, so are we in this world. 18 There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear; for fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not reached perfection in love. 19 We love[b] because he first loved us. 20 Those who say, I love God, and hate a brother or sister are liars, for those who do not love a brother or sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen. 21 The commandment we have from him is this: those who love God must love their brothers and sisters also.

Orthodox Jewish Bible,OJB,1 John,1,,"What was Bereshis (in the Beginning) which we have examined with our ears, which we have seen with our eyes, which we beheld and the hands of us [Shlichim, Ac 1:21-25] touched: the Dvar HaChayyim (Word of Life)! 2 Indeed the Chayyei [Olam] was manifested, and we have seen it and we give solemn eidus (witness of testimony) and we proclaim to you the Chayyei Olam which was alongside with HaAv [Yochanan 1:1-4,14] and made hisgalus (appearance of, exposure of in revelation) to us [Shlichim]. 3 What we have seen and what we have heard, we proclaim also to you, that you also may have deveykus (attachment to G-d) with us [Shlichim of Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach] and our deveykus (attachment to G-d) is with HaAv and with the Zun foon Der Oybershter, Moshiach Yehoshua/Yeshua. 4 And these things we [Shlichim] write, that the simcha of us may be made shleimah. 5 And this is the Besuras HaGeulah which we have heard from Him and which we proclaim to you, that Hashem is Ohr (Light), and in Him choshech there is not any at all. 6 If we make the claim that we have deveykus with Him and in the choshech walk, we speak sheker and have no halakhah in the Derech Emes. 7 But if our halakhah is in the Ohr as He is in the Ohr, we have hitkhabrut (joining, adhesion, fellowship) with one another and the dahm of Yehoshua, HaBen of Hashem, gives us tohorah (purification, cleansing) from kol chet. [YESHAYAH 2:5] 8 If we make the claim that we do not have avon (sin), we cause ourselves to fall under mirmah (deceit, fraud, YESHAYAH 53:9) and HaEmes is not in us. [MISHLE 20:9; YIRMEYAH 2:35] 9 If we make vidduy (confession of sin) of chattoteinu (our sins), he is neeman (faithful) and tzaddik to grant selicha (forgiveness) of chattoteinu (our sins) and give us tohorah (purification, cleansing) from kol avon. [DEVARIM 32:4; TEHILLIM 32:5; 51:2; MISHLE 28:13; MICHOH 7:18-20] 10 If we make the claim that we have not committed averos, a shakran (liar) we make Him, and the dvar of Him is not in us. "
Revised Geneva Translation,RGT,1 John,4,,"Dearly beloved, do not believe every spirit. But test the spirits to see if they are of God. For many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 By this you shall know the Spirit of God: Every spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God. 3 And every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh, is not of God. But this is the spirit of Antichrist, of whom you have heard; how that he would come and is now already in this world. 4 Little children, you are of God; and have overcome them! For greater is He Who is in you than he who is in this world. 5 They are of this world. Therefore, they speak of this world. And this world hears them. 6 We are of God. The one who knows God hears us. The one who is not of God does not hear us. By this we know the Spirit of Truth and the spirit of error. 7 Beloved, let us love one another. For love comes from God. And everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. 8 The one who does not love does not know God. For God is love. 9 In this was that love of God revealed amongst us: because God sent His only begotten Son into this world, so that we might live through Him. 10 In this is that love: not that we loved God, but that He loved us, and sent His Son to be a reconciliation for our sins. 11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. 12 No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwells in us. And His love is perfected in us. 13 By this we know that we dwell in Him, and He in us: because He has given us of His Spirit. 14 And we have seen (and do testify) that the Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the world. 15 Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God - God dwells in him and he in God. 16 And we have known and believed the love that God has in us. God is love. And the one who dwells in love, dwells in God, and God in him. 17 In this is that love perfected in us: that we should have boldness on the Day of Judgment. For as He is, even so are we in this world. 18 There is no fear in love. But perfect love casts out fear. For fear has painfulness. And the one who fears has not been perfected in love. 19 We love Him because He loved us first. 20 If anyone says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar. For how can one who does not love his brother - whom he has seen - love God, Whom he has not seen? 21 And this commandment we have from Him: that the one who loves God should love his brother also. "
Revised Geneva Translation,RGT,1 John,2,,"My little children, these things I write to you so that you do not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father: Jesus Christ, the Just. 2 And He is the reconciliation for our sins; and not only for ours, but also for the whole world. 3 And by this we are sure that we know Him: if we keep His commandments. 4 The one who says, I know him, and does not keep His commandments, is a liar. And the truth is not in him. 5 But whoever keeps His word, in him is the love of God accomplished. By this we know that we are in Him. 6 Whoever says that he remains in Him, ought still to walk as He has walked. 7 Brothers, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning. This old commandment is that word which you have heard from the beginning. 8 Again, a new commandment I write to you (which is true in Him and also in you). For the darkness is passing, and the true Light now shines. 9 Whoever says that he is in the Light, and hates his brother, is in darkness until now. 10 Whoever loves his brother, abides in the Light. And there is no stumbling block in him. 11 But whoever hates his brother, is in darkness, and walks in darkness, and does not know where he goes, because that darkness has blinded his eyes. 12 Little children, I write to you because your sins are forgiven for His Names sake. 13 I write to you, fathers, because you have known Him Who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one. I write to you, little children, because you have known the Father. 14 I have written to you, fathers, because you have known Him Who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the wicked one. 15 Love neither this world nor the things which are in this world. If anyone loves this world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in this world (the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life), is not of the Father, but is of this world. 17 And this world passes away, and the lust thereof. But whoever fulfills the will of God, abides forever. 18 Little children, it is the last hour. And just as you have heard that Antichrist shall come, so now there are many Antichrists (by which we know that it is the last hour). 19 They went out from us, but they were not of us. For if they had been of us, they would have continued with us. But this is so that all of whom are not of us are revealed. 20 But you have an anointing from the Holy One and know all things. 21 I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it (and no lie comes from the truth). 22 Who is a liar, except the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is Antichrist, who denies the Father and the Son. 23 Whoever denies the Son, the same does not have the Father. 24 Therefore, let that same which you have heard from the beginning remain in you. If that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, you shall also continue in the Son and in the Father. 25 And this is the promise that He has promised us: eternal life. 26 These things I have written to you concerning those who deceive you. 27 But that anointing which you received from Him dwells in you. And you do not need anyone to teach you. But as that same anointing teaches you of all things - and it is true, and not lying, and as it is taught to you - you shall abide in Him. 28 And now, little children, abide in Him. So that when He shall appear, we may be bold; and not be ashamed before Him at his coming. 29 If you know that He is righteous, you know that whoever does righteously is born of Him. "
Revised Geneva Translation,RGT,1 John,1,,"That Which was from the beginning, Which we have heard, Which we have seen with our eyes, Which we have looked upon and these hands of ours have handled concerning the Word of Life 2 (for that Life was revealed, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show to you that eternal Life Who was with the Father and was revealed to us); 3 that Which we have seen and heard we declare to you, so that you may also have fellowship with us and that our fellowship may also be with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ. 4 And these things I write to you so that your joy may be full. 5 This, then, is the message which we have heard from Him and declare to you: that God is light. And no darkness is in Him. 6 If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie and do not truly. 7 But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another. And the blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanses us from all sin. 8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves. And truth is not in us. 9 If we acknowledge our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 10 If we say, We have not sinned, we make Him a liar. And His word is not in us. "
Orthodox Jewish Bible,OJB,1 John,4,,"Chaverim, do not believe every ruach. [YIRMEYAH 29:8] But test the ruchot (spirits), if they be of Hashem, because many neviei sheker have gone out into the Olam Hazeh. 2 By this we have daas of the Ruach Hakodesh of Hashem: every ruach which makes hodaah (confession) of Yehoshua, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach as having come in the basar is of Hashem, 3 And every ruach which does not make hodaah of Yehoshua is not of Hashem. And this is the ruach of the Anti-Moshiach, which you have heard that it is coming; and now it already is in the Olam Hazeh. 4 Yeladim, you are of Hashem, and you have overcome them, because greater is the One in you than the one in the Olam Hazeh. [MELACHIM BAIS 6:16] 5 They are of the Olam Hazeh; therefore, of the Olam Hazeh they speak, and the Olam Hazeh pays heed to them. 6 We are of Hashem; the one having daas of Hashem pays heed to us; he who is not of Hashem does not pay heed to us. From this we have daas of the Ruach [Hakodesh] of Emes and the ruach tatuim (spirit of delusion, error). 7 Chaverim, let us have ahavah one for another, because ahavah is of Hashem, and everyone having ahavah has been born of Hashem and has daas of Hashem. 8 The one not having ahavah did not have daas of Hashem, because Hashem is ahavah. 9 By this was made hisgalus of the ahavah of Hashem among us, because Hashem has sent His Ben Yechid into the Olam Hazeh that we may live through Him. [Yn 3:16] 10 In this is ahavah, not that we have had ahavah for Hashem, but that Hashem had ahavah for us and gave His Ben HaElohim as a kapporah for chattoteinu. 11 Chaverim, if Hashem so had ahavah for us, also we ought to have ahavah one for another. 12 No one has ever beheld Hashem. If we have ahavah one for another, G-d makes His maon in us and the Ahavas Hashem in us has been made shleimah. 13 By this we have daas that we have our maon in Him and He in us, because of the Ruach Hakodesh of Him He has given us. 14 And we [Shlichim] have beheld and we give solemn eidus (testimony) that HaAv has sent HaBen as Moshia HaOlam (Goel el kol HaOlam, Oisleizer). 15 Whoever makes moyde (confession) that Yehoshua (Yeshua) is the Ben HaElohim, Hashem makes His maon in him and he in Hashem. 16 And we have had daas and emunah in the ahavah which Hashem has for us. Hashem is ahavah. The one making his maon in ahavah makes his maon in Hashem and Hashem in him. 17 By this has the ahavah become shleimah with us, that we may have bitachon in the Yom HaDin, because as that One is, so we are also in the Olam Hazeh. 18 Pachad (fear) is not in ahavah, but the ahavah hashleimah casts out pachad, because pachad has to do with pachad of the onesh (punishment) and the one with pachad has not been perfected in ahavah. 19 We have ahavah because rishonah He had ahavah for us. 20 If anyone says I have ahavah for Hashem and the Ach bMoshiach he hates, he is a shakran (liar). For the one not having ahavah for the Ach bMoshiach of him whom he has seen, how can he have ahavah for the Elohim whom he has not seen? 21 And this mitzvah we have from Him that the one having ahavah for Hashem should have ahavah also for the Ach bMoshiach of him.

Revised Geneva Translation,RGT,1 John,3,,"Behold, what love the Father has given to us, that we should be called the sons of God! For this reason, this world does not know you: because it does not know Him. 2 Dearly beloved, we are now the sons of God. But what we shall be is yet to be revealed. And we know that when He shall be revealed, we shall be like Him. For we shall see Him as He is. 3 And everyone who has this hope in Him purges himself, just as He is pure. 4 Whoever commits sin, also transgresses the Law. For sin is the transgression of the Law. 5 And you know that He was revealed so that He might take away our sins. And no sin is in Him. 6 Whoever abides in Him does not sin. Whoever sins has neither seen Him nor known Him. 7 Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous (as He is righteous). 8 Whoever commits sin is of the devil. For the devil sins from the beginning. The Son of God was revealed for this purpose: that He might destroy the works of the devil. 9 Whoever is born of God does not sin. For His seed remains in him. Nor can he sin, because he is born of God. 10 In this are the children of God and the children of the devil known. Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother. 11 For this is the message that you heard from the beginning: that we should love one another; 12 not as Cain, who was of the wicked one and killed his brother. And why did he kill him? Because his own works were evil and his brothers good. 13 Do not marvel, my brothers, though this world hates you. 14 We know that we have passed over from death to life because we love the brothers. The one who does not love his brother remains in death. 15 Whoever hates his brother is a murderer. And you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. 16 By this we have perceived love: that He laid down His life for us. Therefore, we also ought to lay down our lives for the brothers. 17 And whoever has this worlds goods and sees his brother has need and shuts up his compassion from him, how does the love of God dwell in him? 18 My little children, let us not love in word or in tongue only, but in deed and in truth. 19 For by this we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before Him. 20 For if our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our heart and knows all things. 21 Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, then we have boldness toward God. 22 And whatever we ask we receive of Him, because we keep His commandments and do those things which are pleasing in His sight. 23 This, then, is His commandment: that we believe in the Name of His Son Jesus Christ and love one another as He commanded. 24 For the one who keeps His commandments dwells in Him, and He in him. And by this we know that He abides in us: by that Spirit which He has given us. "
New Revised Standard Version Updated Edition,NRSVUE,1 John,5,Faith Conquers the World,"Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ[a] has been born of God, and everyone who loves the parent loves the child. 2 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments. 3 For the love of God is this, that we obey his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome, 4 for whatever is born of God conquers the world. And this is the victory that conquers the world, our faith. 5 Who is it who conquers the world but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? 6 This is the one who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ, not with the water only but with the water and the blood. And the Spirit is the one that testifies, for the Spirit is the truth. 7 There are three that testify:[b] 8 the Spirit and the water and the blood, and these three agree. 9 If we receive human testimony, the testimony of God is greater, for this is the testimony of God that he has testified to his Son. 10 Those who believe in the Son of God have the testimony in their hearts. Those who do not believe in God[c] have made him a liar by not believing in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son. 11 And this is the testimony: God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12 Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life. 13 I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life.[d] 14 And this is the boldness we have in him, that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. 15 And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have obtained the requests made of him. 16 If you see your brother or sister committing what is not a deadly sin, you will ask, and God[e] will give life to such a oneto those whose sin is not deadly. There is sin that is deadly; I do not say that you should pray about that. 17 All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that is not deadly. 18 We know that those who are born of God do not sin, but the one who was born of God protects them, and the evil one does not touch them.[f] 19 We know that we are Gods children and that the whole world lies under the power of the evil one. 20 And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding so that we may know him who is true;[g] and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life. 21 Little children, keep yourselves from idols.[h] "

[YESHAYAH 53:9] 6 Everyone making his maon in Him does not go on sinning; everyone sinning has not seen Him nor has had daas of Him. 7 Yeladim, let no [navi sheker, 1Y 4:1] deceive you; the one practicing tzedek is tzodek, even as that One is Tzaddik. 8 The one practicing averos is of Hasatan, because from the beginning Hasatan sins. For this tachlis was made hisgalus of the Ben HaElohim, that he might destroy the peulot Hasatan. 9 Everyone having been born of Hashem is not practicing chet, because His Zera makes maon in him, and he cannot abide sinning, because he is born of Hashem. [TEHILLIM 119:3] 10 By this is made hisgalus of the yeladim of Hashem and the yeladim of Hasatan: everyone not practicing tzedek is not of Hashem; also the one not having ahavah for his Ach bMoshiach. 11 Because this is the divrei Torah which we heard from the beginning, that we have ahavah one for another, 12 Not as Kayin, who was of the evil one, and slaughtered the ach of him; and for what cause did he slaughter him? Because the maasim of him were raim and the maasim of the ach of him were maasei tzedek. [BERESHIS 4:8; TEHILLIM 38:20; MISHLE 29:10] 13 And, Achim bMoshiach, do not marvel if the Olam Hazeh hates you. 14 We have daas that we have made our histalkus (passing) out of Mavet into Chayyim, because we have ahavah for the Achim bMoshiach; the one not having ahavah makes his maon in death. 15 Everyone hating his Ach bMoshiach is a rotzeach (murderer). And you have daas that every rotzeach does not have Chayyei Olam making a maon in him. 16 By this we have had daas of ahavah, because that One on behalf of us laid down his nefesh [YESHAYAH 53:10]; and we ought, on behalf of the Achim bMoshiach, to lay down our nefashot. 17 Now whoever has vital possessions of the Olam Hazeh and sees the Ach bMoshiach of him being nitzrach (needy) and has no rachamim (mercy) on him [DEVARIM 15:7,8] and refuses gemilut Chesed, how does the ahavas Hashem make maon in him? 18 Yeladim, let us not have ahavah in dvar or in lashon but in maaseh and in Emes. [YECHEZKEL 33:31] 19 And by this we will have daas that we are of HaEmes, and before Him we will persuade our levavot, 20 That if our levavot condemn us, Hashem is greater than our levavot, and He has daas of all things. 21 Chaverim, if our levavot do not bring us under the gezar din (verdict) of ashem (guilty), we have bitachon before Hashem. 22 And whatever we request, we receive from Him, because we are shomer of His mitzvot and the things pleasing before Him we practice. 23 And this is the mitzvah of Him, that we have emunah bShem of the Ben HaElohim, Yehoshua, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach, and that we have ahavah one for another, as He gave mitzvah to us. 24 And the one being shomer of His mitzvot makes his maon in Him and He makes His maon in him; and by this we have daas that He abides in us, by the Ruach Hakodesh whom He gave to us. [Yn 14:23,21; Ro 8:9,14,16] "
Orthodox Jewish Bible,OJB,1 John,5,,"Everyone with emunah that Yehoshua (Yeshua) is the Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach has been born of Hashem, and everyone having ahavah for the One having begotten has also ahavah for the one begotten by Him. 2 By this we have daas that we have ahavah for the yeladim of Hashem, when we have ahavas Hashem and we are shomer over His mitzvot. 3 For this is the ahavas Hashem, that we are shomer over His mitzvot, and His mitzvot are not burdensome. [DEVARIM 30:11] 4 Because whatever [T.N. refers to every believer] that has been born of Hashem obtains nitzachon (victory) over the Olam Hazeh. And this is the nitzachon (victory), the nitzachon that overcomes the Olam Hazeh, even [what makes us a believer], our emunah (faith). 5 And who is the one overcoming the Olam Hazeh except the one with emunah that Yehoshua is the Ben HaElohim? 6 This One is the One having come by mayim and dahm, Yehoshua, Rebbe, Melech HaMoshiach; not by the mayim only, but by the mayim and by the dahm; and the Ruach Hakodesh is the one giving solemn eidus, because the Ruach Hakodesh is HaEmes. 7 Because there are shloshah giving solemn eidus: 8 the Ruach Hakodesh and the mayim and the dahm, and the shloshah are for solemn eidus. 9 If the solemn eidus of Bnei Adam we receive, the solemn eidus of Hashem is greater, because this is the eidus of Hashem that He has testified concerning the Son of the Oybeshter. 10 The one with emunah in the Ben HaElohim has the eidus, even the eidus (witness), in himself; the one without emunah in Hashem has made Hashem a shakran (liar), because he has not had emunah in the eidus which Hashem has testified concerning His Ben HaElohim. 11 And this is the eidus, that Hashem gave Chayyei Olam to us, and this Chayyim is in His Ben HaElohim. 12 The one having HaBen has HaChayyim; the one not having HaBen HaElohim does not have Chayyim. 13 These things I wrote to you who have emunah bShem HaBen HaElohim, that you vada (with certainty) may have daas that you have Chayyei Olam. [Yn 20:31] 14 And this is the bitachon which we have with Him, that if we daven and request anything according to His ratzon (will), He hears us. 15 And if we have daas that He hears us, whatever we ask, we have daas that we have the requests which we asked from Him. [MELACHIM ALEF 3:12] 16 If anyone sees his Ach bMoshiach sinning an averah not leading to mavet, he will ask and Hashem will give to him Chayyim, to the ones sinning a chet not leading to mavet. There is an averah leading to mavet. I do not say we should make request concerning that averah. 17 Kol avon is chet, and there is chet not leading to mavet. 18 We have daas that everyone having been born of Hashem does not continually sin, but the One having been born of G-d (Ben HaElohim Moshiach) is shomer over him and Hasatan does not touch him. 19 We have daas that we are of Hashem and the whole Olam Hazeh lies under Hasatan. 20 And we have daas that the Ben HaElohim has come and has given us binah that we may have daas of the One who is the True One, The Omein, and we are in the One who is The Omein, even in HaBen of Him, Moshiach Yehoshua. This one is the El HaAmitti and Chayyei Olam [YIRMEYAH 24:7]. 21 Yeladim, keep yourselves from elilim [YIRMEYAH 5:18] "
Revised Standard Version,RSV,1 John,3,Love One Another,"See what love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him. 2 Beloved, we are Gods children now; it does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. 3 And every one who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure. 4 Every one who commits sin is guilty of lawlessness; sin is lawlessness. 5 You know that he appeared to take away sins, and in him there is no sin. 6 No one who abides in him sins; no one who sins has either seen him or known him. 7 Little children, let no one deceive you. He who does right is righteous, as he is righteous. 8 He who commits sin is of the devil; for the devil has sinned from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil. 9 No one born of God commits sin; for Gods[a] nature abides in him, and he cannot sin because he is[b] born of God. 10 By this it may be seen who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not do right is not of God, nor he who does not love his brother. 11 For this is the message which you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another, 12 and not be like Cain who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brothers righteous. 13 Do not wonder, brethren, that the world hates you. 14 We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love abides in death. 15 Any one who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. 16 By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. 17 But if any one has the worlds goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does Gods love abide in him? 18 Little children, let us not love in word or speech but in deed and in truth. 19 By this we shall know that we are of the truth, and reassure our hearts before him 20 whenever our hearts condemn us; for God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything. 21 Beloved, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God; 22 and we receive from him whatever we ask, because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him. 23 And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he has commanded us. 24 All who keep his commandments abide in him, and he in them. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit which he has given us. "
Revised Standard Version,RSV,1 John,2,Christ Our Advocate,"My little children, I am writing this to you so that you may not sin; but if any one does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; 2 and he is the expiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world. 3 And by this we may be sure that we know him, if we keep his commandments. 4 He who says I know him but disobeys his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him; 5 but whoever keeps his word, in him truly love for God is perfected. By this we may be sure that we are in him: 6 he who says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way in which he walked. 7 Beloved, I am writing you no new commandment, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning; the old commandment is the word which you have heard. 8 Yet I am writing you a new commandment, which is true in him and in you, because[a] the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining. 9 He who says he is in the light and hates his brother is in the darkness still. 10 He who loves his brother abides in the light, and in it[b] there is no cause for stumbling. 11 But he who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes. 12 I am writing to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven for his sake. 13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, children, because you know the Father. 14 I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one. 15 Do not love the world or the things in the world. If any one loves the world, love for the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life, is not of the Father but is of the world. 17 And the world passes away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides for ever. 18 Children, it is the last hour; and as you have heard that antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have come; therefore we know that it is the last hour. 19 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us; but they went out, that it might be plain that they all are not of us. 20 But you have been anointed by the Holy One, and you all know.[c] 21 I write to you, not because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and know that no lie is of the truth. 22 Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son. 23 No one who denies the Son has the Father. He who confesses the Son has the Father also. 24 Let what you heard from the beginning abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then you will abide in the Son and in the Father. 25 And this is what he has promised us,[d] eternal life. 26 I write this to you about those who would deceive you; 27 but the anointing which you received from him abides in you, and you have no need that any one should teach you; as his anointing teaches you about everything, and is true, and is no lie, just as it has taught you, abide in him. 28 And now, little children, abide in him, so that when he appears we may have confidence and not shrink from him in shame at his coming. 29 If you know that he is righteous, you may be sure that every one who does right is born of him.

And his commandments are not burdensome. 4 For whatever is born of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory that overcomes the world, our faith. 5 Who is it that overcomes the world but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? 6 This is he who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ, not with the water only but with the water and the blood. 7 And the Spirit is the witness, because the Spirit is the truth. 8 There are three witnesses, the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three agree.[a] 9 If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater; for this is the testimony of God that he has borne witness to his Son. 10 He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. He who does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has borne to his Son. 11 And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12 He who has the Son has life; he who has not the Son of God has not life. 13 I write this to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life. 14 And this is the confidence which we have in him, that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us. 15 And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have obtained the requests made of him. 16 If any one sees his brother committing what is not a mortal sin, he will ask, and God[b] will give him life for those whose sin is not mortal. There is sin which is mortal; I do not say that one is to pray for that. 17 All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin which is not mortal. 18 We know that any one born of God does not sin, but He who was born of God keeps him, and the evil one does not touch him. 19 We know that we are of God, and the whole world is in the power of the evil one. 20 And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, to know him who is true; and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ.

Revised Standard Version,RSV,1 John,4,Testing the Spirits,"Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are of God; for many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God, 3 and every spirit which does not confess Jesus is not of God. This is the spirit of antichrist, of which you heard that it was coming, and now it is in the world already. 4 Little children, you are of God, and have overcome them; for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world. 5 They are of the world, therefore what they say is of the world, and the world listens to them. 6 We are of God. Whoever knows God listens to us, and he who is not of God does not listen to us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error. 7 Beloved, let us love one another; for love is of God, and he who loves is born of God and knows God. 8 He who does not love does not know God; for God is love. 9 In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. 10 In this is love, not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the expiation for our sins. 11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. 12 No man has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us. 13 By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his own Spirit. 14 And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son as the Savior of the world. 15 Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. 16 So we know and believe the love God has for us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. 17 In this is love perfected with us, that we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because as he is so are we in this world. 18 There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and he who fears is not perfected in love. 19 We love, because he first loved us. 20 If any one says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot[a] love God whom he has not seen. 21 And this commandment we have from him, that he who loves God should love his brother also.

Revised Geneva Translation,RGT,1 John,5,,"Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God. And everyone who loves Him Who begat, also loves him who is begotten of Him. 2 In this we know that we love the children of God: when we love God and keep His commandments. 3 For this is the love of God: that we keep His commandments. And His commandments are not burdensome. 4 For all that is born of God overcomes this world. And this is that victory that has overcome this world: our faith. 5 Who is it that overcomes this world but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? 6 This is that Jesus Christ Who came by water and blood - not by water only, but by water and blood - and it is that Spirit that bears witness. For that Spirit is Truth. 7 For there are Three Who bear record in Heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost. And these three are One. 8 And there are Three Who bear record on the Earth: the Spirit and the Water and the Blood. And these Three agree in One. 9 If we receive the witness of man, the witness of God is greater. For this is the witness of God which He testified about His Son: 10 The one who believes in that Son of God, has the witness in himself. The one who does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed the record that God witnessed of His Son. 11 And this is that record: that God has given us eternal life. And this life is in His Son. 12 The one who has that Son, has that life. And the one who does not have that Son of God, does not have that life. 13 These things I have written to you who believe in the Name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life (and that you may believe in the Name of the Son of God). 14 And this is that assurance that we have in Him: that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. 15 And if we know that He hears us - whatever we ask - we know that we have the petitions that we have desired of Him. 16 If anyone sees his brother sin a sin that does not lead to death, let him ask and He shall give him life for those whose sin does not lead to death. There is sin that leads to death. I do not say that you should pray for that. 17 All unrighteousness is sin. But there is sin that does not lead to death. 18 We know that whoever is born of God does not sin. But the one who is begotten of God guards himself. And the wicked one does not touch him. 19 We know that we are of God, and this whole world lies in wickedness. 20 But we know that the Son of God has come and has given us a mind to know Him Who is true. And we are in Him Who is true; in His Son Jesus Christ. The same is that very God and that Eternal Life. 21 Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen. "

Everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. 8 The one who does not love does not know God, for God is love. 9 The love of God was revealed among us by thisthat God sent His one and only Son into the world so that we might live through Him. 10 This is lovenot that we have loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son as an atonement for our sins. 11 Loved ones, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. 12 No one has ever seen God.[b] If we love one another, God abides in us and His love is made perfect in us. 13 We know that we abide in Him and He in us by thisbecause He has given us of His Spirit. 14 We have seen and testify that the Father has sent His Son as Savior of the world. 15 If anyone acknowledges that Yeshua is Ben-Elohim, God abides in him and he abides in God. 16 So we have come to know and trust in the love that God has for us. God is love. Now whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. 17 In this way, love is made perfect among us, so that we should have boldness on the Day of Judgment. For just as He is, so also are we in this world. 18 There is no fear in love, but perfect love drives out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and the one who fears has not been made perfect in love. 19 We love, because He first loved us. 20 If anyone says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar. For the one who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen. 21 And this commandment we have from Him: that the one who loves God should also love his brother.[c] "
New International Version,NIV,1 John,3,More on Love and Hatred,"See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God!(B) And that is what we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him.(C) 2 Dear friends, now we are children of God,(E) and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when Christ appears,[a](F) we shall be like him,(G) for we shall see him as he is.(H) 3 All who have this hope in him purify themselves, just as he is pure.(J) 4 Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness. 5 But you know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins. And in him is no sin.(M) 6 No one who lives in him keeps on sinning. No one who continues to sin has either seen him(O) or known him.(P) 7 Dear children, do not let anyone lead you astray.(R) The one who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous.(S) 8 The one who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God(U) appeared was to destroy the devils work.(V) 9 No one who is born of God will continue to sin,(X) because Gods seed(Y) remains in them; they cannot go on sinning, because they have been born of God. 10 This is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the devil(AA) are: Anyone who does not do what is right is not Gods child, nor is anyone who does not love(AB) their brother and sister.(AC) 11 For this is the message you heard from the beginning:(AE) We should love one another.(AF) 12 Do not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother.(AH) And why did he murder him? Because his own actions were evil and his brothers were righteous.(AI) 13 Do not be surprised, my brothers and sisters,[b] if the world hates you. 14 We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love each other. Anyone who does not love remains in death.(AL) 15 Anyone who hates a brother or sister is a murderer,(AN) and you know that no murderer has eternal life residing in him.(AO) 16 This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters.(AQ) 17 If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person?(AS) 18 Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth.(AU) 19 This is how we know that we belong to the truth and how we set our hearts at rest in his presence: 20 If our hearts condemn us, we know that God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything. 21 Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God(AW) 22 and receive from him anything we ask, because we keep his commands(AY) and do what pleases him.(AZ) 23 And this is his command: to believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ,(BB) and to love one another as he commanded us.(BC) 24 The one who keeps Gods commands lives in him,(BE) and he in them. And this is how we know that he lives in us: We know it by the Spirit he gave us.(BF) "
Revised Standard Version,RSV,1 John,5,Faith Conquers the World,"Every one who believes that Jesus is the Christ is a child of God, and every one who loves the parent loves the child. 2 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments. 3 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome. 4 For whatever is born of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory that overcomes the world, our faith. 5 Who is it that overcomes the world but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? 6 This is he who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ, not with the water only but with the water and the blood. 7 And the Spirit is the witness, because the Spirit is the truth. 8 There are three witnesses, the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three agree. 9 If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater; for this is the testimony of God that he has borne witness to his Son. 10 He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. He who does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has borne to his Son. 11 And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12 He who has the Son has life; he who has not the Son of God has not life. 13 I write this to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life. 14 And this is the confidence which we have in him, that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us. 15 And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have obtained the requests made of him. 16 If any one sees his brother committing what is not a mortal sin, he will ask, and God[a] will give him life for those whose sin is not mortal. There is sin which is mortal; I do not say that one is to pray for that. 17 All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin which is not mortal. 18 We know that any one born of God does not sin, but He who was born of God keeps him, and the evil one does not touch him. 19 We know that we are of God, and the whole world is in the power of the evil one. 20 And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, to know him who is true; and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. 21 Little children, keep yourselves from idols. "
New International Reader's Version,NIRV,1 John,5,Faith in Gods Son Who Became a Human Being,"Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is a child of God. And everyone who loves the Father loves his children as well. 2 Here is how we know that we love Gods children. We know it when we love God and obey his commands. 3 In fact, here is what it means to love God. We love him by obeying his commands. And his commands are not hard to obey. 4 Thats because everyone who is a child of God has won the battle over the world. Our faith has won the battle for us. 5 Who is it that has won the battle over the world? Only the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God. 6 Jesus Christ was born as we are, and he died on the cross. He wasnt just born as we are. He also died on the cross. The Holy Spirit is a truthful witness about him. Thats because the Spirit is the truth. 7 There are three that are witnesses about Jesus. 8 They are the Holy Spirit, the birth of Jesus, and the death of Jesus. And the three of them agree. 9 We accept what people say when they are witnesses. But its more important when God is a witness. Thats because it is what God says about his Son. 10 Whoever believes in the Son of God accepts what God says about him. Whoever does not believe God is calling him a liar. Thats because they have not believed what God said about his Son. 11 Here is what God says about the Son. God has given us eternal life. And this life is found in his Son. 12 Whoever belongs to the Son has life. Whoever doesnt belong to the Son of God doesnt have life. 13 Im writing these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God. Im writing so you will know that you have eternal life. 14 Here is what we can be sure of when we come to God in prayer. If we ask anything in keeping with what he wants, he hears us. 15 If we know that God hears what we ask for, we know that we have it. 16 Suppose you see any brother or sister commit a sin. But this sin is not the kind that leads to death. Then you should pray, and God will give them life. Im talking about someone whose sin does not lead to death. But there is a sin that does lead to death. Im not saying you should pray about that sin. 17 Every wrong thing we do is sin. But there are sins that do not lead to death. 18 We know that those who are children of God do not keep on sinning. The Son of God keeps them safe. The evil one cant harm them. 19 We know that we are children of God. We know that the whole world is under the control of the evil one. 20 We also know that the Son of God has come. He has given us understanding. So we can know the God who is true. And we belong to the true God by belonging to his Son, Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life. 21 Dear children, keep away from statues of gods. "
Tree of Life Version,TLV,1 John,2,YeshuaAtoned for Our Sin,"My children, I am writing these things to you so that you will not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an Intercessor with the Fatherthe righteous Messiah Yeshua. 2 He is the atonement for our sins, and not only for our sins but also for the whole world.[a] 3 Now we know that we have come to know Him by thisif we keep His commandments. 4 The one who says, I have come to know Him, and does not keep His commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 5 But whoever keeps His word, in him the love of God is truly made perfect. We know that we are in Him by this 6 whoever claims to abide in Him must walk just as He walked. 7 Loved ones, I am not writing a new commandment for you, but an old commandmentone you had from the beginning. This old commandment is the word you have heard. 8 Yet I am writing a new commandment for you, which is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is fading and the true light is already shining. 9 The one who says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in the darkness. 10 The one who loves his brother abides in the light, and in him there is no cause for stumbling. 11 But whoever hates his brother[b] is in the darkness and walks in the darkness. He doesnt know where he is going, because the darkness has made his eyes blind. 12 I am writing to you, children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of His name. 13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you have known the One who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. 14 I have written to you, children, because you have known the Father. I have written to you, fathers, because you have known the One who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one. 15 Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For everything in the worldthe desire of the flesh, the desire of the eyes,[c] and the boasting of lifeis not from the Father but from the world. 17 The world is passing away along with its desire, but the one who does the will of God abides forever. 18 Children, it is the last hour. Just as you heard that the anti-messiah is coming, even now many anti-messiahs have comeby this we know that it is the last hour. 19 They left us, but they didnt really belong to us. If they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us. But they left us so it became clear that none of them belongs to us. 20 But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know. 21 I have not written you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it, and because no lie is of the truth. 22 Who is the liar, if not the one who denies that Yeshua is the Messiah? This one is the anti-messiahthe one who denies the Father and the Son. 23 No one who denies the Son has the Father; the one who acknowledges the Son also has the Father. 24 As for you, let what you heard from the beginning remain in you. If what you heard from the beginning remains in you, you also will continue to live in the Son and in the Father. 25 Now this is the promise that He Himself has promised useternal life. 26 I have written you these things about those who are trying to mislead you. 27 As for you, the anointing you received from Him remains in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you. But as His anointing teaches you about all thingsand it is true and not a lieand just as it has taught you, abide in Him. 28 And now, children, abide in Him, so that when He appears we will have confidence and not be ashamed in His presence at His coming. 29 If you know that He is righteous, you also know that everyone who does what is right is born of Him.

Indeed, our fellowship is with the Father and His Son, Yeshua the Messiah. 4 These things we write so our joy may be full. 5 Now this is the message we have heard from Him and announce to youthat God is light and in Him there is no darkness at all. 6 If we say we have fellowship with Him and keep walking in the darkness, we are lying and do not practice the truth. 7 [a] But if we walk in the light as He Himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another and the blood of His Son Yeshua purifies us from all sin. 8 If we say we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us. 9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. 10 [b] If we say we have not sinned, we make Him a liar and His word is not in us.

Tree of Life Version,TLV,1 John,3,Loving Children Emulate His Actions,"See how glorious a love the Father has given us, that we should be called Gods childrenand so we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know Him. 2 Loved ones, now we are Gods children; and it has not yet been revealed what we will be. But we do know that when its revealed, we shall be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is. 3 Everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure. 4 Everyone practicing sin also practices lawlessnessindeed, sin is lawlessness. 5 You know that Yeshua appeared in order to take away sins, and in Him there is no sin. 6 No one who abides in Him keeps on sinning; no one who sins has seen Him or known Him. 7 Children, let no one mislead you! The one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as Yeshua is righteous. 8 The one who practices sin is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. Ben-Elohim appeared for this purposeto destroy the works of the devil. 9 No one born of God practices sin, because Gods seed remains in him. He cannot sin, because he is born of God. 10 It is clear who are the children of God and who are the children of the devil by thisanyone who does not act righteously or love his brother is not of God. 11 For this is the message you have heard from the beginningwe should love one another. 12 Do not be like Cain, who was from the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his deeds were evil, while his brothers were righteous. 13 [a] Do not be surprised, brothers and sisters, if the world hates you. 14 We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love our brothers and sisters. The one who does not love remains in death. 15 Everyone who hates his brother is a murdererand you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. 16 We have come to know love by thisYeshua laid down His life for us, and we also ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters. 17 But if someone has material possessions and sees his brother in need and closes his heart against him[b], how does the love of God abide in him? 18 Children, let us not love with word or talk, but in deed and truth! 19 By this we shall know that we are of the truth, and set our heart at rest before Him 20 whenever our heart condemns us. For God is greater than our heart, and knows all things. 21 Loved ones, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God; 22 and whatever we ask, we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do what is pleasing in His sight. 23 Now this is His commandmentthat we should believe in the name of His Son, Yeshua the Messiah, and love one another, just as He commanded us. 24 The one who keeps His commandments abides in God, and God in him. We know that He abides in us by thisby the Spirit He has given us. "
The Voice,VOICE,1 John,1,,"We want to tell you about the One who was from the beginning. We have seen Him with our own eyes, heard Him with our own ears, and touched Him with our own hands. This One is the manifestation of the life-giving Voice, 2 and He showed us real life, eternal life. We have seen it all, and we cant keep what we witnessed quietwe have to share it with you. We are inviting you to experience eternal life through the One who was with the Father and came down to us. 3 What we saw and heard we pass on to you so that you, too, will be connected with us intimately and become family. Our family is united by our connection with the Father and His Son Jesus, the Anointed One; 4 and we write all this because retelling this story fulfills our[a] joy. 5 What we are telling you now is the very message we heard from Him: God is pure light, undimmed by darkness of any kind. 6 If we say we have an intimate connection with the Father but we continue stumbling around in darkness, then we are lying because we do not live according to truth. 7 If we walk step by step in the light, where the Father is, then we are ultimately connected to each other through the sacrifice of Jesus His Son. His blood purifies us from all our sins. 8 If we go around bragging, We have no sin, then we are fooling ourselves and are strangers to the truth. 9 But if we own up to our sins, God shows that He is faithful and just by forgiving us of our sins and purifying us from the pollution of all the bad things we have done. 10 If we say, We have not sinned, then we depict God as a liar and show that we have not let His word find its way into our hearts. "
Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition,RSVCE,1 John,3,Love One Another,"See what love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him. 2 Beloved, we are Gods children now; it does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. 3 And every one who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure. 4 Every one who commits sin is guilty of lawlessness; sin is lawlessness. 5 You know that he appeared to take away sins, and in him there is no sin. 6 No one who abides in him sins;[a] no one who sins has either seen him or known him. 7 Little children, let no one deceive you. He who does right is righteous, as he is righteous. 8 He who commits sin is of the devil; for the devil has sinned from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil. 9 No one born of God commits sin; for Gods[b] nature abides in him, and he cannot sin because he is[c] born of God. 10 By this it may be seen who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not do right is not of God, nor he who does not love his brother. 11 For this is the message which you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another, 12 and not be like Cain who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brothers righteous. 13 Do not wonder, brethren, that the world hates you. 14 We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love remains in death. 15 Any one who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. 16 By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. 17 But if any one has the worlds goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does Gods love abide in him? 18 Little children, let us not love in word or speech but in deed and in truth. 19 By this we shall know that we are of the truth, and reassure our hearts before him 20 whenever our hearts condemn us; for God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything. 21 Beloved, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God; 22 and we receive from him whatever we ask, because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him. 23 And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he has commanded us. 24 All who keep his commandments abide in him, and he in them. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit which he has given us. "
Tree of Life Version,TLV,1 John,5,Love GodLive Gods Word,"Everyone who believes that Yeshua is the Messiah is born of God, and everyone who loves the Father loves the one born of Him. 2 We know that we love Gods children by thiswhen we love God and obey His commandments. 3 For this is the love of Godthat we keep His commandments. And His commandments are not burdensome. 4 For everyone born of God overcomes the world. And the victory that has overcome the world is thisour faith. 5 Who is it that overcomes the world, if not the one who believes that Yeshua is Ben-Elohim? 6 Messiah Yeshua is the One who came by water and bloodnot by water only, but by water and blood. The Spirit is the One who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. 7 For there are three that testify 8 the Spirit, the water, and the bloodand these three are one. 9 [a] If we accept mens testimony, Gods testimony is greaterfor this it is the testimony that God has given about His Son. 10 The one who trusts in Ben-Elohim has the testimony in himself; the one who does not trust in God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given about His Son. 11 And the testimony is thisthat God gave us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. 12 The one who has the Son has life; the one who does not have Ben-Elohim does not have life. 13 I wrote these things to you who believe in the name of Ben-Elohim, so you may know that you have eternal life. 14 Now this is the confidence we have before Himthat if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. 15 And if we know that He hears uswhatever we askwe know that we have the requests we have asked from Him. 16 If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death, he should ask, and God will give life to those who commit sin not leading to death. There is a sin leading to deathI am not saying you should ask about that. 17 [b] All unrighteousness is sin, but there is sin not leading to death. 18 We know that anyone born of God does not keep on sinning; rather, the One born of God keeps him safe, and the evil one cannot touch him. 19 We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one. 20 And we know that Ben-Elohim has come and given us insight, so that we may know Him who is trueand we are in Him who is true, in His Son Yeshua the Messiah. This One is the true God and eternal life. 21 Children, guard yourselves from idols.[c] "
The Voice,VOICE,1 John,4,,"My loved ones, I warn you: do not trust every spirit. Instead, examine them carefully to determine if they come from God, because the corrupt world is filled with the voices of many false prophets. 2 Here is how you know Gods Spirit: if a spirit affirms the truth that Jesus the Anointed, our Liberating King, has come in human flesh, then that spirit is from God. 3 If a spirit does not affirm the true nature of Jesus the Anointed, then that spirit does not come from God and is, in fact, the spirit of the antiChrist.[a] You have heard about its coming; in fact it is already active in the world. 4 My children, you have come from God and have conquered these spirits because the One who lives within you is greater than the one in this world. 5 But they are of this world, and they articulate the views of the corrupt world, which the world understands. 6 We come from God, and those who know God hear us. Whoever is not from God will not listen to us. This is the way we discern the difference between the spirit of truth and the spirit of deception. How can the words of prophets be tested to discover the truth? The most important question is whether they acknowledge that Jesus is fully God and fully human. In the first century, many people were so convinced that this material world was corrupt and evil that they couldnt imagine how a perfect God could wrap Himself in imperfect skin. Many today still function as if the physical world is a bad thing; this understanding is demonstrated when they downplay the hope of bodily resurrection and emphasize the heavenly destination of souls. Implicitly, this belittles Jesus own incarnation and resurrection. On the other hand, many people accept Jesus humanity but deny His divinity. He may have been a great teacher, they say, but certainly not the incarnation of God. However, Jesus made bold claims about who He was and what He came to do. These are not the things a great teacher would have said or done if they had not been true. It is fair to say that no other life has drawn so much scrutiny, and no other life has ever elicited such praise. 7 My loved ones, let us devote ourselves to loving one another. Love comes straight from God, and everyone who loves is born of God and truly knows God. 8 Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love. 9 Because of this, the love of God is a reality among us: God sent His only Son into the world so that we could find true life through Him. 10 This is the embodiment of true love: not that we have loved God first, but that He loved us and sent His unique Son on a special mission to become an atoning sacrifice for our sins. 11 So, my loved ones, if God loved us so sacrificially, surely we should love one another. 12 No one has ever seen God with human eyes; but if we love one another, God truly lives in us. Consequently Gods love has accomplished its mission among us. 13 How can we be sure that He truly lives in us and that we truly live in Him? By one fact: He has given us His Spirit. 14 We have watched what God has done, and we stand ready to provide eyewitness testimonies to the reality that the Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the world. 15 If anyone unites with our confession that Jesus is Gods own Son, then God truly lives in that person and that person lives in God. 16 We have experienced and we have entrusted our lives to the love of God in us. God is love. Anyone who lives faithfully in love also lives faithfully in God, and God lives in him. 17 This love is fulfilled with us, so that on the day of judgment we have confidence based on our identification with Jesus in this world. 18 Love will never invoke fear. Perfect love expels fear, particularly the fear of punishment. The one who fears punishment has not been completed through love. 19 We love because He has first loved us. 20 If someone claims, I love God, but hates his brother or sister, then he is a liar. Anyone who does not love a brother or sister, whom he has seen, cannot possibly love God, whom he has never seen. 21 He gave us a clear command, that all who love God must also love their brothers and sisters. "
The Voice,VOICE,1 John,2,,"The word sin has virtually disappeared from modern conversation. Afraid of sounding judgmental, we call sin something elsea mistake, an addiction, a tendency, a bad decisionand ignore it as normal and natural behavior. But John is calling the church to a radical holiness where those in the church will regularly remember their sins and seek Gods forgiveness. Each sin, small and large, injures us or someone else; it imprints on our soul, makes us imperfect, and separates us from the perfect God. If we confess our sins to God each day, then He will purify our hearts and draw us closer to Him. You are my little children, so I am writing these things to help you avoid sin. If, however, any believer does sin, we have a high-powered defense lawyerJesus the Anointed, the righteousarguing on our behalf before the Father. 2 It was through His sacrificial death that our sins were atoned. But He did not stop thereHe died for the sins of the whole world. John is affectionately addressing this letter to his little children, and he is writing to help them avoid sin and the pain and guilt that come with it. The glamour of decadent lifestyles devoid of God is often advertised as the epitome of joy and freedom. But what are often conveniently left out of these portrayals are the agonizing consequences of such destructive lifestyles. Meaningful pleasure comes not when we are enslaved by the empty promises of the world, but when we are living in loving obedience to God. 3 We know we have joined Him in an intimate relationship because we live out His commands. 4 If someone claims, I am in an intimate relationship with Him, but this big talker doesnt live out His commands, then this individual is a liar and a stranger to the truth. 5 But if someone responds to and obeys His word, then Gods love has truly taken root and filled him. This is how we know we are in an intimate relationship with Him: 6 anyone who says, I live in intimacy with Him, should walk the path Jesus walked. 7 My loved ones, in one sense, I am not writing a new command for you. I am only reminding you of the old command. Its a word you already know, a word that has existed from the beginning. 8 However, in another sense, I am writing a new command for you. The new command is the truth that He lived; and now you are living it, too, because the darkness is fading and the true light is already shining among you. 9 Anyone who says, I live in the light, but hates his brother or sister is still living in the shadows. 10 Anyone who loves his brother or sister lives in the light and will not trip because his conscience is clear. 11 But anyone who hates his brother is in the darkness, stumbling around with no idea where he is going, blinded by the darkness. We are deeply loved by God. When we turn and love those members of our faith family whom God loves, we are set apart and different from the world. 12 I am writing to you, my children, because your sins have been forgiven by the authority of His name. 13 I am writing to you, fathers and mothers, because you have known Him as the Creator, as the One who started everything. I am writing to you, young people, because He has given you the power to conquer the evil one. 14 I have written to you, my children, because you have known the Father. I have written to you, fathers and mothers, because you have known Him, the Creator. I have written to you, young people, because the voice of God remains and is heard among you. Remember that you have conquered the evil one. 15 Dont fall in love with this corrupt world or worship the things it can offer. Those who love its corrupt ways dont have the Fathers love living within them. 16 All the things the world can offer to youthe allure of pleasure, the passion to have things, and the pompous sense of superioritydo not come from the Father. These are the rotten fruits of this world. 17 This corrupt world is already wasting away, as are its selfish desires. But the person really doing Gods willthat person will never cease to be. 18 My children, this is the final hour. You have heard that the antiChrist, the greatest enemy to His kingdom, is coming, but in fact, many antiChrists are already here. This development tells us how late it really is. 19 A group has left us, but they were not part of our family. If they were truly our brothers and sisters, they would have remained for the duration with us. When they left, they made it ever so obvious that they were not part of us. 20 You have been given an anointing, a special touch from the Holy One. You know the truth.[a] 21 I am not writing to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it. You know that no lie belongs to the truth. 22 The liar is the one who says, Jesus is not really the Anointed One. This is the antiChrist, the one denying both the Father and the Son. 23 Anyone who denies the Son does not know the Father. The one affirming the Son enjoys an intimate relationship with the Father as well. 24 Let the good news, the story you have heard from the beginning of your journey, live in and take hold of you. If that happens and you focus on the good news, then you will always remain in a relationship with the Son and the Father. 25 This is what He promised us: eternal life. 26 I also am writing to warn you about some who are attempting to deceive you. 27 You have an anointing. You received it from Him, and His anointing remains on you. You do not need any other teacher. But as His anointing instructs you in all the essentials (all the truth uncontaminated by darkness and lies), it teaches you this: Remain connected to Him. 28 So now, my little children, live in Him, so that whenever He is revealed, we will have confidence and not have to hang our heads in shame before Him when He comes. 29 If you know that He is just and faithful, then you also know that everyone who lives faithfully and acts justly has been born into a new life through Him. "
Worldwide English (New Testament),WE,1 John,2,,"My children, I am writing these things to you so that you will not do wrong things. But if anyone does something wrong, we have a Friend to help us. He speaks to God for us. He is Jesus Christ who does what is right. 2 He himself is the sacrifice God offered to pay for the wrong we have done. And he pays for the wrong things all people in all the world have done. 3 We can be sure that we know him when we obey his laws. 4 If any man says, `I know him' and does not obey his laws, he is telling a lie. He does not know what is true. 5 But if any man obeys his word, he really loves God. Here is the way that we may be sure that we belong to him. 6 If any man says he belongs to him, he must live in the same way Christ lived. 7 My dear brothers, I am not writing you a new law. This is an old law. You had it from the beginning. The old law is the word which you have heard. 8 But in a way, I am writing you a new law. The darkness is going away and the true light is shining already. 9 Does anyone say he is in the light, and hates his brother? Then he is still in the dark. 10 The man who loves his brother lives in the light. There is nothing in him to make him do wrong. 11 But the man who hates his brother is in the dark. He lives in the dark. He does not know where he is going, because the darkness has made him blind. 12 Children, I am writing to you because God has forgiven the wrong things you have done. Your wrong ways have been forgiven because of what Christ did. 13 Fathers, I am writing to you because you know the One who has lived from the beginning. Young men, I am writing to you because you have won the victory over the devil. Children, I write to you because you know Father God. 14 Fathers, I write to you because you know him, the one who has lived from the beginning. Young men, I write to you because you are strong. You believe God's word. You have won the victory over the devil. 15 Do not love the world, or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, he does not love the Father. 16 Nothing in the world comes from the Father. I mean the wrong things people like to do with their bodies. I mean the things people see and want to have. I mean all the things people are proud of in this life. These things come from the world, not the Father. 17 And the world will go away and all the things in it that people like to do. But the person who does what God wants him to do will live for ever. 18 Children, we are very near the end of time. You have heard that someone will come who is against Christ. Many who are against Christ have already come. That is how we know that we are very near the end of time. 19 They left us, but they did not belong with us. If they had belonged with us, they would have stayed with us. But they left us so that people could see that all of them did not belong with us. 20 But the Holy One has given you a gift of understanding so that you all may know what is true. 21 I write to you, not because you do not know what is true, but because you do know. And you know that no lie is true. 22 Who then is the one who says what is not true? It is the one who says that Jesus is not the Christ. That person is against Christ, because he says there is no Father and there is no Son. 23 Everyone who says Jesus is not the Son does not know the Father. And everyone who says Jesus is the Son knows the Father. 24 So keep what you have heard from the beginning. If you keep what you have heard from the beginning, you too belong to the Son and to the Father. 25 And he himself has promised us that we will live for ever. 26 I have written these things to you about the ones who try to fool you. 27 You have a gift of understanding from Christ. That gift stays with you. You do not need anyone to teach you. His gift teaches you about everything. It is true. It is not a lie. So stay with him as he has taught you. 28 Now, my children, stay with Christ. Then we will not be afraid on that day when we see him again. We will not be ashamed to stand before him when he comes again. 29 You know that he does what is right. So you know also that everyone who does what is right is his child. "
Wycliffe Bible,WYC,1 John,3,,"See ye what manner charity the Father gave to us, that we be named the sons of God, and be his sons. For this thing the world knew not us, for it knew not him [For this thing the world knoweth not us, for it knoweth not him]. 2 Most dear brethren, now we be the sons of God, and yet it appeared not, what we shall be. We know, that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. 3 And each man that hath this hope in him, maketh himself holy, as [and] he is holy. 4 Each man that doeth sin, doeth also wickedness, and sin is wickedness. 5 And ye know, that he appeared to do away sins, and sin is not in him. 6 Each man that dwelleth in him, sinneth not; and each that sinneth, seeth not him, neither knew him. 7 Little sons, no man deceive you; he that doeth rightwiseness, is just, as also he is just. 8 He that doeth sin, is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. In this thing the Son of God appeared, that he undo the works of the devil. 9 Each man that is born of God, doeth not sin; for the seed of God dwelleth in him, and he may not do sin [and he may not sin], for he is born of God. 10 In this thing the sons of God be known, and the sons of the fiend. Each man that is not just, is not of God, and he that loveth not his brother [and he that loveth not his brother, is not of God]. 11 For this is the telling, that ye heard at the beginning, that ye love each other; 12 not as Cain, that was of the devil, and slew his brother. And for what thing slew he him? for his works were evil, and his brother's just. 13 Brethren, do not ye wonder, if the world hateth you. 14 We know, that we be translated from death to life, for we love brethren. He that loveth not, dwelleth in death. 15 Each man that hateth his brother, is a manslayer; and ye know, that each manslayer hath not everlasting life dwelling in him. 16 In this thing we have known the charity of God, for he put his life for us, and we owe to put our lives for our brethren. 17 He that hath the chattel of this world, and seeth that his brother hath need [He that shall have the substance of this world, and shall see his brother have need], and closeth his entrails from him, how dwelleth the charity of God in him? 18 My little sons, love we not in word, neither in tongue, but in work and truth. 19 In this thing we know, that we be of truth, and in his sight we admonish our hearts. 20 For if our heart reprove us, God is more than our heart, and knoweth all things. 21 Most dear brethren, if our heart reproveth not us, we have trust to God; 22 and whatever we shall ask, we shall receive of him, for we keep his commandments, and we do those things that be pleasant before him. 23 And this is the commandment of God, that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and that we love each other [And this is the commandment of him, that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love each other], as he gave behest to us. 24 And he that keepeth his commandments, dwelleth in him, and he in him. And in this thing we know, that he dwelleth in us, by the Spirit, whom he gave to us. "
Worldwide English (New Testament),WE,1 John,1,,"The Word of life always was living, even from the beginning. We heard him. We saw him with our own eyes. We looked at him, and we touched him with our own hands. We are writing to you about this Word of life. 2 This life came to earth. We saw him, and we know about him. And we tell you about this life that lives for ever. This life was with the Father and came to us. 3 We tell you also what we have seen and heard. We tell you so that you also will belong with us. And we belong with the Father and the Son. 4 We write these things to you so that we all will be very happy. 5 God is like light and he is not dark at all. That is the message we heard from him. That is the message we are telling you. 6 Do we say that we belong with him? And at the same time, do we live in the dark? Then what we say is not true, and what we do is not right. 7 Do we live in the light, as God is in the light? Then we belong with others who belong to him. And the blood of the death of Jesus Christ makes us clean from all the wrong things we have done. 8 Do we say, `We have no wrong ways'? Then we are fooling ourselves, and we do not know what is true. 9 Let us tell God about our wrong ways. God can be trusted. He does what is right. He will forgive us for the wrong things we have done. He will make us clean from all that was wrong. 10 Do we say, `We have not done anything wrong'? This is like saying that God is not true. That means we do not accept God's word. "
Worldwide English (New Testament),WE,1 John,3,,"See how much the Father has loved us! We are called God's children. It is true, we are God's children. People in this world did not know him and so they do not know us. 2 My dear brothers, we are God's children now. No one knows yet what we shall be like. But we know that when Jesus comes, we will be like him. We will see him as he really is. 3 Everyone who has this hope about Christ makes his life holy. He makes his life holy and clean, just as Christ is holy. 4 Everyone who does wrong things is breaking God's law. Doing wrong things is breaking the law. 5 You know that Christ came to take away the wrong things people have done. He is the one who has done no wrong. 6 Everyone who stays with him does not do wrong things. Everyone who does wrong things has never seen him and has never known him. 7 My children, do not let anyone fool you. Anyone who does what is good, is good just as Christ is good. 8 Anyone who does what is wrong belongs to the devil. The devil has done what is wrong from the beginning. That is why God's Son came. He came to stop what the devil does. 9 No one who is God's child does wrong things, because God's life is in him. And he cannot keep on doing wrong things, because he is God's child. 10 This is how people can know who are God's children and who are the devil's children. Everyone who does not do right is not God's child. And anyone who does not love his brother is not God's child. 11 This is the word you have heard from the beginning. `We must love one another.' 12 We must not be like Cain. He was a child of the devil and killed his brother. Why did he kill him? He killed him because the things he himself did were wrong, and the things his brother did were right with God. 13 My brothers, do not be surprised if people in this world hate you. 14 We know that we have gone from death to life. We know this because we love the Christian brothers. Anyone who does not love them has not gone from death to life. 15 Everyone who hates his brother is like a man who kills a person. And you know that no one who kills a person has life that will live for ever. 16 Christ died for us. That is how we know what love is. We also should be willing to die for our brothers. 17 Perhaps a man has plenty of food and things. He sees that his brother needs some. If he does not want to help his brother, does he love God? 18 My children, we must not only talk about loving people; we must show we love people by what we do for them. We must really love them. 19 And this is how we will know that we are true. This is why we will not be afraid in front of God. 20 Even if our hearts think we are wrong, God is greater than our hearts and he knows everything. 21 My dear brothers, if our hearts do not think we are wrong, we will not be afraid in front of God. 22 If we ask God for something, we get it. We get it because we obey his laws. We get it because we do what pleases him. 23 This is his law. We must believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ. And we must love one another as he told us to do. 24 If anyone obeys his laws, he belongs to God and God belongs to him. God has given us the Holy Spirit. That is how we know that God is with us. "
Wycliffe Bible,WYC,1 John,2,,"My little sons, I write to you these things, that ye sin not. But if any man sinneth, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ [just], 2 and he is the forgiveness for our sins; and not only for our sins [and he is helping for our sins; soothly not only for ours], but also for the sins of all the world. 3 And in this thing we know, that we know him, if we keep his commandments. 4 He that saith that he knoweth God, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and truth is not in him. 5 But the charity of God is perfect verily in him, that keepeth his word [Forsooth who keepeth his word, verily in him is perfect charity]. In this thing we know, that we be in him, if we be perfect in him. 6 He that saith, that he dwelleth in him, he oweth to walk, as he walked. 7 Most dear brethren, I write to you, not a new commandment, but the old commandment, that ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word, that ye heard. 8 Again I write to you a new commandment, that is true both in him and in you; for darknesses be passed, and very light shineth now [and very light now shineth]. 9 He that saith, that he is in light, and hateth his brother, is in darknesses yet [is in darkness till to yet]. 10 He that loveth his brother, dwelleth in light, and cause of stumbling is not in him [and offence is not in him]. 11 But he that hateth his brother, is in darknesses, and wandereth in darknesses, and knoweth not whither he goeth; for darknesses have blinded his eyes. 12 Little sons, I write to you, that your sins be forgiven to you for his name. 13 Fathers, I write to you, for ye have known him, that is from the beginning. Young men, I write to you, for ye have overcome the wicked. I write to you, young children [I write to you, infants, or young children], for ye have known the Father. 14 I write to you, brethren, for ye have known him, that is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, for ye be strong, and the word of God dwelleth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked. 15 Do not ye love the world, nor those things that be in the world [neither those things that be in the world]. If any man loveth the world, the charity of the Father is not in him. 16 For all thing that is in the world, is covetousness of flesh, and covetousness of eyes, and pride of life, which is not of the Father, but it is of the world. 17 And the world shall pass, and the covetousness of it; but he that doeth the will of God, dwelleth without end [dwelleth into without end]. 18 My little sons, the last hour is; and as ye have heard, that antichrist cometh, now many antichrists be made; wherefore we know [whereof we know], that it is the last hour. 19 They went forth from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they had dwelt with us; but that they be known, that they be not all of us [but that they be known, that they be not of us]. 20 But ye have anointing of the Holy Ghost, and know all things. [But ye have unction of the Holy Ghost, and know all things.] 21 I wrote not to you, as to men that know not the truth, but as to men that know it, and for each lying is not of truth. 22 Who is a liar, but this that denieth that Jesus is not Christ? This is antichrist, that denieth the Father, and the Son. 23 For each that denieth the Son, hath not the Father; but he that acknowledgeth the Son, hath also the Father. 24 That thing that ye heard at the beginning, dwell it in you [That thing that ye heard from the beginning, dwell in you]; for if that thing dwelleth in you [for if it shall dwell in you], which ye heard at the beginning, [and] ye shall dwell in the Son and in the Father. 25 And this is the promise, that he promised to us everlasting life. 26 I wrote these things to you, of them that deceive you, 27 and that the anointing which ye received of him, dwell in you. And ye have not need, that any man teach you, but as his anointing teacheth you of all things, and it is true, and it is not lying; and as he taught you, dwell ye in him. 28 And now, ye little sons, dwell ye in him, that when he shall appear, we have trust, and be not confounded of him in his coming. 29 If ye know that he is just, know ye that also each that doeth rightwiseness, is born of him. "
The Voice,VOICE,1 John,5,,"Its easy to say I love God, but genuine love reflects Gods love. If we belong to God, then we will love each other regardless of how hard love is. Everyone who trusts Jesus as the long-awaited Anointed One is a child of God, and everyone who loves the Father cannot help but love the child fathered by Him. 2 Then how do we know if we truly love Gods children? We love them if we love God and keep His commands. 3 You see, to love God means that we keep His commands, and His commands dont weigh us down. 4 Everything that has been fathered by God overcomes the corrupt world. This is the victory that has conquered the world: our faith. 5-6 Who is the person conquering the world? It is the one who truly trusts that Jesus is the Son of God, that Jesus the Anointed is the One who came by water and bloodnot by the water only, but by the water and the blood. Just as we do not get to choose our biological brothers and sisters, we do not get to choose our spiritual brothers and sisters either. But what comes along with loving the Father is loving all His other childreneven the really annoying ones! While it might seem to be easier to go off and live in isolation rather than put up with those we are not naturally attracted to, there are responsibilities that come with living in a spiritual family. We reflect our worship of God by living in respect with our Christian brothers and sisters. How we treat the people around us on a daily basis is the real test of our love for God. The Spirit of God testifies to this truth because the Spirit is the truth. 7 So there are three testifying witnesses: 8 the Spirit, the water, and the blood. All three are in total agreement. 9 If we accept the testimonies of people, then we must realize the testimony of God is greater than that of any person. God certified the truth about His own Son. 10 Anyone who trusts the Son of God has this truthful testimony at the core of his being. Anyone who does not trust God calls God a liar because he ignores Gods truthful testimony regarding His own Son. 11 And this is the truth: God has given us the gift of eternal life, and this life is in His Son. 12 If you have the Son, you have eternal life. If you do not have the Son of God, you are not acquainted with true life. 13 I am writing all of this to you who have entrusted your lives to the Son of Godso you will realize eternal life already is yours. 14 We live in the bold confidence that God hears our voices when we ask for things that fit His plan. 15 And if we have no doubt that He hears our voices, we can be assured that He moves in response to our call. 16 In this regard, if you notice a brother or sister in faith making moral missteps and blunders, disregarding and disobeying God even to the point of God removing this one from the body by death, then pray for that person; and God will grant him life on this journey. But to be clear, there is a sin that is ultimately fatal and leads to death. I am not talking about praying for that fatal sin, 17 but I am talking about all those wrongs and sins that plague Gods family that dont lead to death. 18 We all know that everyone fathered by God will not make sin a way of life because God protects His children from the evil one, and the evil one cant touch them. 19 Have confidence in the fact that we belong to God, but also know that the world around us is in the grips of the evil one. 20 We also can be sure of the fact that the Son of God has come and given us a mind so that we may know Him as the embodiment of all that is true. We live in this truth, in His Son Jesus, the Anointed One. He is the True God and eternal life. 21 My little children, keep away from idols. Johns final bit of pastoral advice sounds an alarm against idolatry. If we look carefully at our culture and into our own hearts, we will find we are ultimately concerned about ourselves, our entertainment, our comforts, and our wallets. None of these are worthy of our highest devotion; but we put more time, energy, money, and emotion into these than we do into the one true God. So Johns warning should be heeded: watch out for the steady impulse to love other things more than God. "
Worldwide English (New Testament),WE,1 John,5,,"Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is God's child. And everyone who loves the Father loves his child. 2 This is how we know we love God's children. We love God and we obey his laws. 3 We show that we love God when we obey his laws. His laws are not hard to obey. 4 Everyone who is God's child wins a victory over the world. We win because we believe God. 5 Who wins a victory over the world? It is only the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God. 6 There was water and there was blood when Jesus Christ came. There was not water only, but there was water and there was blood. The Spirit proves this is true, because the Spirit is true. 7 There are three in heaven who prove it is true. They are the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit. These three are one. 8 There are three on earth who prove it is true. They are the spirit, the water, and the blood. These three all prove the same thing. 9 We believe what people prove to us. But when God proves something it is stronger than what people prove. This is what God proved about his Son. 10 Anyone who believes in God's Son believes what God says about him. Anyone who does not believe God shows that he thinks what God says is not true. He has not believed what God says about his Son. 11 Here is what God says. He has given us life that will last for ever. And this life is in his Son. 12 So anyone who has the Son has this life. Anyone who does not have the Son of God does not have this life. 13 I have written these things to you who believe on the name of the Son of God. I have written them so that you will know that you will live for ever. 14 And we are sure God will do this. If we ask him for anything that he wants us to have, he will listen to us. 15 And if we know he listens to us when we ask for anything, then we know that we have what we asked him for. 16 Maybe a man sees his brother do something wrong, but not so bad that he must die for it. The man should ask God and God will let his brother live. God will let people live if the things they have done are not so bad that they must die for them. But there are things so wrong that a person must die for them. If he has done such as that, I do not tell the man to ask God to let him live. 17 Everything that is wrong is a bad thing. But not every bad thing is so wrong that a person must die for it. 18 We know that any child of God does not do wrong things. The Son of God keeps him safe and the devil cannot touch him. 19 We know that we belong to God and the whole world belongs to the devil. 20 We know that the Son of God has come. He has given us a heart to know him who is true. We belong to him who is true, because we belong to his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God. He has the life that will live for ever. 21 My children, have nothing to do with false gods or idols. "
World English Bible,WEB,1 John,3,,"See how great a love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God! For this cause the world doesnt know us, because it didnt know him. 2 Beloved, now we are children of God. It is not yet revealed what we will be; but we know that when he is revealed, we will be like him; for we will see him just as he is. 3 Everyone who has this hope set on him purifies himself, even as he is pure. 4 Everyone who sins also commits lawlessness. Sin is lawlessness. 5 You know that he was revealed to take away our sins, and no sin is in him. 6 Whoever remains in him doesnt sin. Whoever sins hasnt seen him and doesnt know him. 7 Little children, let no one lead you astray. He who does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous. 8 He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. To this end the Son of God was revealed: that he might destroy the works of the devil. 9 Whoever is born of God doesnt commit sin, because his seed remains in him, and he cant sin, because he is born of God. 10 In this the children of God are revealed, and the children of the devil. Whoever doesnt do righteousness is not of God, neither is he who doesnt love his brother. 11 For this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another; 12 unlike Cain, who was of the evil one, and killed his brother. Why did he kill him? Because his deeds were evil, and his brothers righteous. 13 Dont be surprised, my brothers, if the world hates you. 14 We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. He who doesnt love his brother remains in death. 15 Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him. 16 By this we know love, because he laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers. 17 But whoever has the worlds goods and sees his brother in need, then closes his heart of compassion against him, how does Gods love remain in him? 18 My little children, lets not love in word only, or with the tongue only, but in deed and truth. 19 And by this we know that we are of the truth, and persuade our hearts before him, 20 because if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things. 21 Beloved, if our hearts dont condemn us, we have boldness toward God; 22 so whatever we ask, we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight. 23 This is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he commanded. 24 He who keeps his commandments remains in him, and he in him. By this we know that he remains in us, by the Spirit which he gave us. "
World English Bible,WEB,1 John,5,,"Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God. Whoever loves the Father also loves the child who is born of him. 2 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep his commandments. 3 For this is loving God, that we keep his commandments. His commandments are not grievous. 4 For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world: your faith. 5 Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? 6 This is he who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and the blood. It is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. 7 For there are three who testify:[a] 8 the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and the three agree as one. 9 If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater; for this is Gods testimony which he has testified concerning his Son. 10 He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. He who doesnt believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son. 11 The testimony is this, that God gave to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 12 He who has the Son has the life. He who doesnt have Gods Son doesnt have the life. 13 These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may continue to believe in the name of the Son of God. 14 This is the boldness which we have toward him, that if we ask anything according to his will, he listens to us. 15 And if we know that he listens to us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him. 16 If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin not leading to death, he shall ask, and God will give him life for those who sin not leading to death. There is a sin leading to death. I dont say that he should make a request concerning this. 17 All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not leading to death. 18 We know that whoever is born of God doesnt sin, but he who was born of God keeps himself, and the evil one doesnt touch him. 19 We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one. 20 We know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding, that we know him who is true, and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. 21 Little children, keep yourselves from idols. "

Yes, and our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son, Jesus Christ. 4 And we write these things to you, that our joy may be fulfilled. 5 This is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. 6 If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we lie, and dont tell the truth. 7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanses us from all sin. 8 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us the sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 10 If we say that we havent sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.

Wycliffe Bible,WYC,1 John,1,,"That thing that was from the beginning [Which thing was from the beginning], which we heard, which we saw with our eyes, which we beheld, and our hands touched, of the word of life; 2 and the life is showed.

World English Bible,WEB,1 John,2,,"My little children, I write these things to you so that you may not sin. If anyone sins, we have a Counselor[a] with the Father, Jesus Christ, the righteous. 2 And he is the atoning sacrifice[b] for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world. 3 This is how we know that we know him: if we keep his commandments. 4 One who says, I know him, and doesnt keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth isnt in him. 5 But Gods love has most certainly been perfected in whoever keeps his word. This is how we know that we are in him: 6 he who says he remains in him ought himself also to walk just like he walked. 7 Brothers, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you heard from the beginning. 8 Again, I write a new commandment to you, which is true in him and in you; because the darkness is passing away and the true light already shines. 9 He who says he is in the light and hates his brother is in the darkness even until now. 10 He who loves his brother remains in the light, and there is no occasion for stumbling in him. 11 But he who hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness, and doesnt know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes. 12 I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his names sake. 13 I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, little children, because you know the Father. 14 I have written to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God remains in you, and you have overcome the evil one. 15 Dont love the world or the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the Fathers love isnt in him. 16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, isnt the Fathers, but is the worlds. 17 The world is passing away with its lusts, but he who does Gods will remains forever. 18 Little children, these are the end times, and as you heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have arisen. By this we know that it is the final hour. 19 They went out from us, but they didnt belong to us; for if they had belonged to us, they would have continued with us. But they left, that they might be revealed that none of them belong to us. 20 You have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all have knowledge.[c] 21 I have not written to you because you dont know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth. 22 Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the Antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son. 23 Whoever denies the Son doesnt have the Father. He who confesses the Son has the Father also. 24 Therefore, as for you, let that remain in you which you heard from the beginning. If that which you heard from the beginning remains in you, you also will remain in the Son, and in the Father. 25 This is the promise which he promised us, the eternal life. 26 These things I have written to you concerning those who would lead you astray. 27 As for you, the anointing which you received from him remains in you, and you dont need for anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you, you will remain in him. 28 Now, little children, remain in him, that when he appears, we may have boldness, and not be ashamed before him at his coming. 29 If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who practices righteousness has been born of him.

Worldwide English (New Testament),WE,1 John,4,,"My dear brothers, do not trust every spirit. But test the spirits to see if they belong to God. There are many prophets who are not true who have gone out into the world. 2 Here is how you can know the Spirit of God. Every spirit that believes that Jesus Christ has come in the body of a man is from God. 3 And every spirit that does not say this about Jesus, does not belong to God. That is the spirit of the one who is against Christ. You have heard that he is coming. And now he is already in the world. 4 My children, you belong to God. You have won the victory over those prophets who are not true. You have won because the Spirit that is in you is stronger than the spirit that is in the world. 5 Those prophets belong to the world. That is why they teach about things in the world. And that is why the people of the world listen to them. 6 But we belong to God. Anyone who knows God listens to us. Anyone who does not belong to God does not listen to us. This is how we know if a spirit is true or not true. 7 My dear brothers, we must love one another, because love comes from God. Everyone who loves others is God's child and he knows God. 8 But anyone who does not love others does not know God, because God is love. 9 This is how God showed his love for us. He sent his only Son into the world to give us life. 10 This is love! We did not love God, but he loved us. And he sent his Son to be the sacrifice to pay for the wrong things we have done. 11 My dear brothers, if God loved us so much, we must love one another also. 12 No man has ever seen God. But God lives in us if we love one another. And in loving one another, his love is made perfect. 13 He has given us of his own Spirit. That is how we know that we are in him and he is in us. 14 And we have seen and we are telling you that the Father sent his Son to save the people in the world. 15 If anyone says, `Jesus is the Son of God,' God is in him and he is in God. 16 We know and we believe that God loves us. God is love. And anyone who loves others is in God and God is in him. 17 That is why we love each other very much. Then we will not be afraid on the day when people are judged. We are like Christ in this world. 18 Where God's love is, there is no fear. God's perfect love takes away fear. It is punishment that makes a person fear. Anyone who has fear does not have perfect love. 19 We love others because God first loved us. 20 If anyone says, `I love God', and he hates his brother, he is telling a lie. If he does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen? 21 God gave us this law. The person who loves God must love his brother also. "
Wycliffe Bible,WYC,1 John,4,,"Most dear brethren, do not ye believe to each spirit, but prove ye the spirits, if they be of God; for many false prophets went out into the world. 2 In this thing the Spirit of God is known; each spirit that acknowledgeth that Jesus Christ hath come in flesh, is of God; 3 and each spirit that undoeth Jesus, is not of God. And this is antichrist, of whom ye have heard, that he cometh; and right now he is in the world. 4 Ye, little sons, be of God, and ye have overcome him; for he that is in you is more, than he that is in the world. 5 They be of the world, therefore they speak of the world, and the world heareth them. 6 We be of God; he that knoweth God, heareth us; he that is not of God, heareth not us. In this thing we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error. 7 Most dear brethren, love we together, for charity is of God; and each that loveth his brother, is born of God, and knoweth God. 8 He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is charity. 9 In this thing the charity of God appeared in us, for God sent his one begotten Son into the world, that we live by him. 10 In this thing is charity, not as we had loved God, but for he first loved us, and sent his Son forgiveness for our sins [and sent his Son helping for our sins]. 11 Ye most dear brethren, if God loved us, [and] we owe to love each other. 12 No man saw ever God; if we love together, God dwelleth in us, and the charity of him is perfect in us. 13 In this thing we know, that we dwell in him, and he in us; for of his Spirit he gave to us. 14 And we saw, and witness, that the Father sent his Son Saviour of the world. 15 Whoever acknowledgeth [Who-ever shall acknowledge], that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. 16 And we have known, and believe to the charity, that God hath in us. God is charity, and he that dwelleth in charity, dwelleth in God, and God in him. 17 In this thing is the perfect charity of God with us [In this thing is the perfect charity of God in us], that we have trust in the day of doom; for as he is, also we be in this world. 18 Dread is not in charity, but perfect charity putteth out dread [but perfect charity sendeth out dread]; for dread hath pain. But he that dreadeth, is not perfect in charity. 19 Therefore love we God, for he loved us before.[a] 20 If any man saith, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar. For he that loveth not his brother, whom he seeth, how may he love God, whom he seeth not? 21 And we have this commandment of God, that he that loveth God, love also his brother. "

Wycliffe Bible,WYC,1 John,5,,"Each man that believeth that Jesus is Christ, is born of God; and each man that loveth him that engendered [and each that loveth him that gendereth], loveth him that is born of him. 2 In this thing we know, that we love the children of God, when we love God, and do his commandments. 3 For this is the charity of God, that we keep his commandments; and his commandments be not heavy [and his commandments be not grievous]. 4 For all thing that is born of God, overcometh the world; and this is the victory that overcometh the world, our faith. 5 And who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? 6 This is Jesus Christ, that came by water and blood; not in water only, but in water and blood. And the Spirit is he that witnesseth, that Christ is [the] truth. 7 For three be, that give witnessing in heaven, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost [For three be, that bear witness in heaven, the Father, the Word, or Son, and the Holy Ghost]; and these three be one. 8 And three be, that give witnessing in earth, the Spirit, water, and blood; and these three be one. 9 If we receive the witnessing of men, the witnessing of God is more; for this is the witnessing of God, that is more, for he witnessed of his Son. 10 He that believeth in the Son of God, hath the witnessing of God in him. He that believeth not to the Son, maketh him a liar; for he believeth not in the witnessing, that God witnessed of his Son. 11 And this is the witnessing, for God gave to you everlasting life [for God gave to us everlasting life], and this life is in his Son. 12 He that hath the Son of God, hath also life [He that hath the Son, hath life]; he that hath not the Son of God, hath not life. 13 I write to you these things, that ye know, that ye have everlasting life, which believe in the name of God's Son. 14 And this is the trust which we have to God [And this is the trust that we have in God], that whatever thing we ask after his will, he shall hear us. 15 And we know, that he heareth us, whatever thing we ask; we know, that we have the askings, that we ask of him [which we ask of him]. 16 He that knoweth that his brother sinneth a sin not to death [He that knoweth his brother to sin a sin not to death], ask he, and life shall be given to him that sinneth not to death. There is a sin to death; not for it I say, that any man pray. 17 Each wickedness is sin, and there is [a] sin to death. 18 We know, that each man that is born of God, sinneth not; but the generation of God keepeth him, and the wicked toucheth him not. 19 We know, that we be of God, and all the world is set in evil [and all the world is put in wicked]. 20 And we know, that the Son of God came in flesh, and gave to us wit, that we know him very God, and be in the very Son [Jesus] of him [and be in the very Son Jesus of him].

Young's Literal Translation,YLT,1 John,3,,"See ye what love the Father hath given to us, that children of God we may be called; because of this the world doth not know us, because it did not know Him; 2 beloved, now, children of God are we, and it was not yet manifested what we shall be, and we have known that if he may be manifested, like him we shall be, because we shall see him as he is; 3 and every one who is having this hope on him, doth purify himself, even as he is pure. 4 Every one who is doing the sin, the lawlessness also he doth do, and the sin is the lawlessness, 5 and ye have known that he was manifested that our sins he may take away, and sin is not in him; 6 every one who is remaining in him doth not sin; every one who is sinning, hath not seen him, nor known him. 7 Little children, let no one lead you astray; he who is doing the righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous, 8 he who is doing the sin, of the devil he is, because from the beginning the devil doth sin; for this was the Son of God manifested, that he may break up the works of the devil; 9 every one who hath been begotten of God, sin he doth not, because his seed in him doth remain, and he is not able to sin, because of God he hath been begotten. 10 In this manifest are the children of God, and the children of the devil; every one who is not doing righteousness, is not of God, and he who is not loving his brother, 11 because this is the message that ye did hear from the beginning, that we may love one another, 12 not as Cain -- of the evil one he was, and he did slay his brother, and wherefore did he slay him? because his works were evil, and those of his brother righteous. 13 Do not wonder, my brethren, if the world doth hate you; 14 we -- we have known that we have passed out of the death to the life, because we love the brethren; he who is not loving the brother doth remain in the death. 15 Every one who is hating his brother -- a man-killer he is, and ye have known that no man-killer hath life age-during in him remaining, 16 in this we have known the love, because he for us his life did lay down, and we ought for the brethren the lives to lay down; 17 and whoever may have the goods of the world, and may view his brother having need, and may shut up his bowels from him -- how doth the love of God remain in him? 18 My little children, may we not love in word nor in tongue, but in word and in truth! 19 and in this we know that of the truth we are, and before Him we shall assure our hearts, 20 because if our heart may condemn -- because greater is God than our heart, and He doth know all things. 21 Beloved, if our heart may not condemn us, we have boldness toward God, 22 and whatever we may ask, we receive from Him, because His commands we keep, and the things pleasing before Him we do, 23 and this is His command, that we may believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and may love one another, even as He did give command to us, 24 and he who is keeping His commands, in Him he doth remain, and He in him; and in this we know that He doth remain in us, from the Spirit that He gave us.

By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error. 7 Beloved, lets love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves has been born of God, and knows God. 8 He who doesnt love doesnt know God, for God is love. 9 By this Gods love was revealed in us, that God has sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 10 In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son as the atoning sacrifice[a] for our sins. 11 Beloved, if God loved us in this way, we also ought to love one another. 12 No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God remains in us, and his love has been perfected in us. 13 By this we know that we remain in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit. 14 We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world. 15 Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in him, and he in God. 16 We know and have believed the love which God has for us. God is love, and he who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him. 17 In this, love has been made perfect among us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, because as he is, even so we are in this world. 18 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has punishment. He who fears is not made perfect in love. 19 We love him, because he first loved us. 20 If a man says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who doesnt love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen? 21 This commandment we have from him, that he who loves God should also love his brother. "
The Voice,VOICE,1 John,3,,"Consider the kind of extravagant love the Father has lavished on usHe calls us children of God! Its true; we are His beloved children. And in the same way the world didnt recognize Him, the world does not recognize us either. When we feel like we are not good enough to be loved by God, we should remember that Gods love is greater than our doubts. We must silence the sounds of condemnation so we can hear the voice of Gods loving assurance and remember that He has selected us to be part of His family. 2 My loved ones, we have been adopted into Gods family; and we are officially His children now. The full picture of our destiny is not yet clear, but we know this much: when Jesus appears, we will be like Him because we will see Him just as He is. 3 All those who focus their hopes on Him and His coming seek to purify themselves just as He is pure. 4 Everyone who lives a life of habitual sin is living in moral anarchy. Thats what sin is. 5 You realize that He came to eradicate sins, that there is not the slightest bit of sin in Him. 6 The ones who live in an intimate relationship with Him do not persist in sin, but anyone who persists in sin has not seen and does not know the real Jesus. 7 Children, dont let anyone pull one over on you. The one doing the right thing is just imitating Jesus, the Righteous One. If you are wondering if your faith is authentic, take a look at your life. Are you doing what is right? 8 The one persisting in sin belongs to the diabolical one, who has been all about sin from the beginning. That is why the Son of God came into our world: to destroy the plague of destruction inflicted on the world by the diabolical one. 9 Everyone who has been born into Gods family avoids sin as a lifestyle because the genes of Gods children come from God Himself. Therefore, a child of God cant live a life of persistent sin. 10 So it is not hard to figure out who are the children of God and who are the children of the diabolical one: those who lack right standing and those who dont show love for one another do not belong to God. 11 The central truththe one you have heard since the beginning of your faithis that we must love one another. 12 Please do not act like Cain, who was of the evil one. He brutally murdered his own brother.[a] Why would he do something so despicable? Because his life was devoted to evil and selfishness, and his brother chose to do what is right. 13 Brothers and sisters, dont be shocked if the corrupt world despises you. 14 We know that we have crossed over from death to real life because we are devoted to true love for our brothers and sisters. Anyone who does not love lives among corpses. Do you ever wonder if you are just silently sleeping through days, months, and years? There is one indicator of real life: true love for others. 15 Everyone who hates other members of Gods family is a murderer. Does a murderer possess the beautiful life that never ends? No. 16 We know what true love looks like because of Jesus. He gave His life for us, and He calls us to give our lives for our brothers and sisters. 17 If a person owns the kinds of things we need to make it in the world but refuses to share with those in need, is it even possible that Gods love lives in him? 18 My little children, dont just talk about love as an idea or a theory. Make it your true way of life, and live in the pattern of gracious love. 19-20 There is a sure way for us to know that we belong to the truth. Even though our inner thoughts may condemn us with storms of guilt and constant reminders of our failures, we can know in our hearts that in His presence God Himself is greater than any accusation. He knows all things. 21 My loved ones, if our hearts cannot condemn us, then we can stand with confidence before God. 22 Whatever we may ask, we receive it from Him because we follow His commands and take the path that pleases Him. 23 His command is clear: believe in the name of His Son, Jesus the Anointed, and love one another as He commanded. 24 The one who follows His teaching and walks this path lives in an intimate relationship with God. How do we know that He lives in us? By the gift of His Spirit. "
